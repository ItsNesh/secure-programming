I need to create concise study notes from the textbook chapter about passwords. Let me analyze what's most important based on the instructions.

First, I'll identify key concepts that would be relevant for exams and understanding:

1. **Password management challenges** - The fundamental issues with password systems (usability vs security)
2. **Password choice problems** - Common patterns in weak passwords
3. **Security questions as recovery mechanisms** - Why they're problematic
4. **Two-factor authentication** - Evolution from SMS to apps, and vulnerabilities like SIM swapping
5. **Passphrases vs random passwords** - Research on what works best for memorability and security
6. **Password storage techniques** - One-way encryption with salts, common failures
7. **Phishing attacks & social engineering** - How they exploit password systems
8. **Password managers** - Benefits and risks of using them

Now I'll condense these into concise bullet points following the formatting requirements.

Let me organize this information in a way that's scannable for study purposes, focusing on what students need to know for exams:

- Key terms should be bolded when first introduced
- Only include essential examples (like Sarah Palin hack)
- Focus on concepts rather than detailed historical context

I'll structure the notes with clear headings and bullet points. I won't include all 25 slides but will focus on extracting only what's most important for exam preparation.

Let me create a concise summary of this chapter focusing on key concepts:

1. **Password Management Challenges** - Passwords are fundamentally flawed due to human cognitive limitations (recall vs recognition, difficulty with complex passwords)
2. **Common Weaknesses in Password Choice** - Dictionary words, common names, patterns like "password1", and predictable sequences
3. **Security Questions as Recovery Mechanisms** - Highly insecure; Sarah Palin hack via mother's maiden name & birth date
4. **Two-Factor Authentication Evolution** - SMS (vulnerable to SIM swap) → Authenticator apps (more secure)
5. **Passphrase vs Random Passwords Research** - Mnemonic passphrases offer best balance of memorability and security
6. **Password Storage Best Practices** - One-way encryption with salts, avoiding plaintext storage
7. **Phishing & Social Engineering Vulnerabilities** - Banks training customers to click links while phishing is rampant

Now I'll create the actual study notes following all formatting requirements.

I need to be careful about length - target 30-40% of original text (which was quite long). The textbook slides were numbered up to Slide 25, so my summary should be significantly shorter than that.

# Week 1: Passwords - Study Notes

## Core Challenges with Password Systems
- **Fundamental flaw**: Humans struggle with passwords due to cognitive limitations:
  - Recall is harder than recognition
  - People can't remember infrequently-used or frequently-changed items
  - Non-meaningful words are more difficult (Sasse)
- **Marketing vs security conflict**: Most password requirements exist for business purposes, not user protection

## Password Choice & Weaknesses
| Type | Example | Risk Level |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Naive choice | "password", "123456" | Very High (7.4% of passwords) |
| Common names | "Sarah", "Michael" | Medium-High (4%) |
| Patterns | "password1", "julia03" | High |
| Dictionary words | "apple", "sunshine" | Medium |

- **Key research**: Bonneau's analysis showed:
  - ~25% of passwords could be guessed with moderate effort
  - Passphrases (e.g., "It's 12 noon and I am hungry") offer best balance: as memorable as naive choices, but harder to guess than random strings

## Password Recovery Systems
- **Security questions**:
  - Highly insecure (Sarah Palin hack via birth date & school)
  - 37% of answers wrong; 16% publicly available
  - Now largely replaced by email/SMS recovery
- **Two-factor authentication evolution**:
  - SMS: Stops 96% bulk phishing, but vulnerable to SIM swap attacks
  - Authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator): Stop 99% bulk phishing & 90% targeted attacks

> 💡 *SIM-swap attack example*: Attacker pretends to be you at mobile carrier to get replacement SIM card; became main bank fraud method in Nigeria, then US.

## Password Storage Best Practices
- **One-way encryption with salt**:
  - Generate random "salt" value for each password
  - Combine password + salt → apply slow cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-512)
  - Store both salt and hashed result
- **Avoid**: 
  - Storing passwords in plaintext or weakly encrypted form
  - Using default passwords that can't be changed

## Critical Password Management Failures
| Failure Type | Example | Consequence |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Default passwords not reset | Early dial systems with "admin" password | Chronic vulnerability (Mirai botnet) |
| Passwords in plain sight | Sticky notes on monitors | Easy physical access for attackers |
| Forced regular changes | Monthly requirement | Users create predictable patterns ("julia03") |

> ⚠️ **NIST 2017 update**: Ended mandatory password expiration; recommends long passphrases instead.

## Phishing & Social Engineering
- **Banking industry paradox**:
  - Banks train customers to click links (marketing) while phishing is rampant
  - Customers trained to do unsafe actions: "Check the English" → phishers use bank's own emails with modified URLs

- **Effective warnings**: Specific, concrete messages work better than vague ones ("The site you're about to visit has malware designed to steal your banking details").

## Password Managers (Pros & Cons)
| Benefit | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Store unique random passwords for each service | Master password forgotten = all accounts compromised |
| Auto-fill only on correct domains | Malware can extract stored credentials |
| Identify reused passwords across sites | Third-party managers often have security flaws |

> 💡 **Best practice**: Use browser-based manager with master password; avoid storing critical passwords (banking/email) in browsers.

## Future of Authentication
- **"Something you are"** (biometrics): Fingerprint readers on phones, but still used *with* passwords for recovery
- **Physical tokens** (e.g., CAP reader): Used by banks as two-factor authentication
- **No password future?**: Unlikely - most systems will continue using passwords with supplementary methods

> 🔑 **Key insight**: Passwords remain the shaky foundation of security, but their weaknesses drive innovation in other authentication methods.
