# Comprehensive Study Notes: Chapter 2 - Who Is The Opponent?

## Introduction
Security engineering requires understanding potential adversaries before designing secure systems. As Anderson states, "Ideally you should know who might attack your system and how." This knowledge is essential because:

- Systems can be attacked by a wide range of opponents (spies, crooks, hackers, bullies)
- Understanding the threat model helps determine appropriate security measures
- It's important to figure out *how* systems were attacked after incidents occur

## Section 1: Spies - Government Actors

### Key Concept: Intelligence vs. Crime Ecosystems
Intelligence agencies and cybercriminals operate in overlapping ecosystems, with some actors moving between the two (e.g., Russian criminals working for state actors).

---

### The Five Eyes Alliance
- **Definition**: A signals intelligence alliance comprising five countries:
  - United States (NSA)
  - United Kingdom (GCHQ)
  - Canada (CSE)
  - Australia (ASD)
  - New Zealand (GCSB)

**Key Programs and Capabilities:**

| Program | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Prism** | NSA program collecting data directly from tech companies' servers via legal coercion under FISA ยง702 | Enabled mass collection of emails, chats, videos without warrants; revealed by Snowden in 2013 |
| **Tempora** | GCHQ's fiber optic cable tapping program (operating since ~2008) | Collected "bulk data" from international cables before it reached the UK; used to identify targets for further surveillance |
| **Muscular** | NSA/GCHQ operation targeting cloud services (Google, Microsoft) via direct access at points of interconnection with service providers | Allowed collection of user content without needing warrants or court orders |
| **Special Collection Service (SCS)** | Physical intelligence gathering unit within the CIA and NSA that deploys teams to install surveillance equipment on networks worldwide | Focuses on physical infrastructure rather than digital attacks |

---

### Cryptographic Weakness Programs

**Bullrun/Edgehill**
- **Definition**: A joint NSA/GCHQ program focused on weakening or bypassing encryption standards
- **Methods**:
  - Inserting backdoors into cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Dual_EC_DRBG)
  - Paying companies to weaken security features in their products
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in commercial cryptography implementations

> "The world's intelligence agencies and contractors employ several hundred software engineers who write malware for the criminal market."

**Xkeyscore**
- **Definition**: A global database system used by NSA/GCHQ analysts to search through collected data (emails, chat logs, etc.)
- **Functionality**:
  - Allows searching across millions of intercepted communications
  - Uses metadata and content analysis to identify targets
  - Can correlate information from multiple sources

---

### Offensive Cyber Operations

**Stuxnet**
- **Description**: A sophisticated cyber weapon targeting Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities (2010)
- **Technical Details**:
  - Targeted Siemens industrial control systems at Natanz uranium facility
  - Spread via USB drives to avoid network detection
  - Caused centrifuges to spin out of control, damaging equipment
- **Impact**: Delayed Iranian nuclear program by several years; first known cyber weapon used against physical infrastructure

> "Stuxnet was followed by Iran tracing the CIA's covert communications network and rounding up a number of agents."

**Quantum**
- **Definition**: NSA operation targeting SSL/TLS encryption to intercept secure web traffic
- **Methodology**:
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in TLS implementations (e.g., BEAST, POODLE)
  - Inserting man-in-the-middle attacks on encrypted connections
  - Using compromised servers as "honeypots" for interception

---

### CNE vs. Cybercrime Infrastructure
| Feature | Intelligence Agencies | Criminal Organizations |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Espionage, national security | Financial gain |
| **Target Selection** | Strategic targets (dissidents, foreign governments) | Mass market attacks on vulnerable systems |
| **Infrastructure Use** | Botnets for surveillance; malware for persistent access | Botnets primarily as revenue-generating infrastructure |
| **Attack Methodology** | Spear-phishing with sophisticated tools | Credential stuffing and phishing at scale |

> "Both spies and crooks use malware to establish botnets as infrastructure."

---

## Section 2: China's Cyber Capabilities

### Key Focus Areas
- Espionage against dissidents (both inside China and overseas)
- Targeted attacks on foreign government systems
- Industrial espionage for economic advantage

**Notable Attacks**
1. **Diginotar CA Hack**: Chinese hackers compromised a Dutch certificate authority to monitor Gmail traffic of dissidents.
2. **Shamoon Malware**: Damaged thousands of PCs at Aramco (Saudi oil company) in 2012.

> "Iran has also been the target of US and other attacks... Stuxnet, after which it traced the CIA's covert communications network."

---

## Section 3: Russia's Cyber Activities

### Dual-Use Capabilities
Russia exhibits a unique blend where:
- Criminal cybercrime infrastructure is used for state purposes (e.g., ransomware groups)
- State actors employ similar techniques as criminal organizations but with different objectives

**Key Example**: The **Equifax breach**
- Initial story: Hackers exploited Apache Struts vulnerability to access personal data of 145.5 million Americans
- Later analysis suggested Chinese military involvement based on the scale and nature of stolen information (indicted in 2020)
- "No criminal use has been made of any of the stolen information, which led analysts at the time to suspect that the perpetrator was a nation-state actor"

**Ransomware Trends**
- Russia-based ransomware groups have evolved from targeting individuals to large organizations
- Shift toward payment methods like gift cards (42% in 2016-17) rather than cryptocurrency

---

## Section 4: Other Government Actors

### United Arab Emirates & Saudi Arabia
**Absher App**: 
- An app that enables men in Saudi Arabia to control women's activities, including travel restrictions and access to services.
- Available on Apple/Google stores despite being illegal under European law (over half of abusers tracked using it are from Europe).

> "The availability [of Absher] has led to protests against Apple and Google elsewhere in the world."

### Iran
**Cyber Capabilities**: 
- Developed indigenous capabilities after sanctions isolated them.
- Focus on intelligence operations, particularly targeting dissidents at home and overseas.

**Notable Attacks**:
1. **Diginotar CA Hack**: Monitored Gmail of Iranian dissidents via compromised Dutch certificate authority.
2. **Shamoon Malware**: Damaged thousands of PCs at Aramco (Saudi oil company).

### North Korea
**Key Incidents**:
- **Sony Pictures Attack (2014)**: 
  - Hacker group trashed Sony infrastructure, released embarrassing emails causing top executive resignation.
  - Threatened terrorist attacks if comedy about North Korean leader was shown in theaters.

- **Wannacry Ransomware (2017)**:
  - Infected over 200,000 computers worldwide using EternalBlue vulnerability.
  - Demanded bitcoin ransom but lacked selective decryption capability (effectively destructive).
  - Disrupted production at Nissan/Renault and TSMC chip foundries.

> "In 2018, the US Department of Justice unsealed an indictment... for a series of electronic bank robberies including $81m from Bank of Bangladesh."

---

## Section 5: Attribution Challenges

### Why Attribution is Difficult
- **Anonymity online**: Cyber attacks can be masked through multiple layers.
- **False flags**: Attackers deliberately leave misleading evidence.

**Case Studies**
| Incident | Initial Suspect | Actual Attributed Actor |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Climategate (2009)** | Russians, Saudis, energy companies | Internal leak or accident; filename "FOIA2009.zip" suggests it was prepared for freedom-of-information disclosure |

**Key Insight**: 
> "Even smart people make mistakes in operational security that give them away."

---

## Section 6: Cybercrime Ecosystem

### Key Concept: Industrialization of Crime
Modern cybercrime has evolved from a cottage industry to an industrialized ecosystem with specialized roles.

#### Criminal Infrastructure Specializations (2019 Survey)
| Role | Description | Revenue Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Botnetherders** | Operators who build and maintain botnets for rent or sale | $5-7 billion annually in costs imposed on industry/society |
| **Malware Developers** | Specialize in creating exploits, remote access Trojans (RATs), command-and-control systems | Hundreds of developers; revenue from malware-as-a-service models |
| **Spam Senders** | Operate at scale to bypass spam filters using constantly changing techniques | $1 billion annually for ISPs/tech companies vs. ~$10 million profit for operators |
| **Cashout Gangs** | Specialize in converting stolen funds into usable currency through money laundering | Evolves with financial regulations (e.g., Liberty Reserve, Bitcoin) |

---

### Botnet Evolution

#### Early Botnets
- **Earthlink Spammer (2000)**: Sent over a million phishing emails; sued by Earthlink.
- **Cutwail Botnet (2007)**: Sent 50+ million spam messages per minute from over a million infected machines.

#### Modern Botnets & Innovations

| Botnet | Key Innovation | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Storm** | Peer-to-peer network for communication; used eDonkey P2P to find other bots | Accounted for 8% of all Windows malware in 2007; later reduced by defenders. |
| **Conficker** | Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) creating 50,000 domains/day | Infected ~10 million machines at peak; required industry-wide cooperation to mitigate. |
| **Mirai** | Exploited IoT devices with default passwords | First major attack on DynDNS in 2016 took down Twitter for six hours; over a thousand variants since. |

> "The latest innovation is Mirai, which exploits IoT devices... scanning IPv4 address space for vulnerable devices."

---

### Banking & Payment System Attacks

#### Phishing Evolution
| Era | Attack Method | Defense Response |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| **2005** | Mass phishing emails mimicking banks (e.g., "Your account has been compromised") | Banks introduced two-factor authentication; asked for few password letters at a time. |
| **~2009** | Credential-stealing malware (Zeus) that lurks on PCs until user logs into bank site | Malware connects in real-time to human operators ("man-in-the-browser" attacks). |

#### Business Email Compromise
- **Method**: Criminals compromise business email accounts and impersonate executives.
  - Example: "CEO orders financial controller to make payment"
  - Or: "Customer's account number has changed; please update information"

> "Most targeted attacks on company payment systems can in theory be prevented by the control procedures that most large firms already have."

---

### Sectoral Cybercrime Ecosystems

**Travel Fraud Example**
- **Ecosystem**: 
  - Sells fraudulently obtained airline tickets (stolen credit cards, hacked travel agency systems)
  - Uses spam and affiliate marketing scams to sell cut-price tickets
  - Some passengers know they're dubious; others are duped ("dupe" = innocent victim)

> "The scammers also supply tickets at the last minute so that alarms are usually too late."

---

### Internal Attacks & Whistleblowing

#### CEO Crimes (Industrial Espionage)
- **Volkswagen Emissions Scandal**: 
  - Diesel engines programmed to run cleanly during emissions tests.
  - CEO fired, indicted in USA; Audi CEO jailed in Germany.
  - VW set aside โฌ25 billion for fines and compensation.

> "The use of cryptography for accessory control is now pervasive... even on water filter cartridges."

#### Whistleblower Challenges
- **Barclays Bank Case (2018)**: 
  - CEO fined ยฃ642,000 for attempting to trace a whistleblower.
  
**Key Insight**: 
> "The critical factor [for whistleblowers] is whether the whistleblower will get external support."

---

## Section 7: Researchers & Whistleblowers ("Geeks")

### Responsible Disclosure
- **Definition**: Process where researchers disclose vulnerabilities to vendors before public disclosure, typically with a grace period.
- **Evolution**:
  - Early days (pre-2000s): Companies threatened legal action for vulnerability reports.
  - Mid-2000s: Industry adopted responsible disclosure practices.
  - Now: Many firms operate bug-bounty programs offering rewards.

> "Many firms now offer serious money selling vulnerabilities, and more than one assiduous researcher has earned over $1 million doing this."

---

## Section 8: The Swamp - Abuse Against Persons

### Key Concept: Scale of Personal Abuse
- **Cyberbullying**: Affects ~25% of children/young people (13% verbal, 5% cyber).
- **Intimate Partner Abuse**: Suffered by 27% of women and 11% of men.

---

### Hacktivism & Hate Campaigns

#### Gamergate Case Study
- **Origin**: Abusive comments about female game developer made public by former boyfriend (August 2014).
- **Evolution**:
  - Cascaded into misogynistic criticism of women in gaming industry.
  - Coordinated on anonymous message boards like 4chan.
  - Targeted doxxing, SWATting ("SWAT teams sent to target's house").
  - Contributed to development of "alt-right" movement influencing the 2016 election.

> "The harassment was coordinated... with one continuing theme being a rant against 'social justice warriors'."

---

### Child Sex Abuse Material (CSAM)

#### Legal Challenges
- **Budapest Convention (2001)**: First international treaty regulating CSAM.
- **Key Problem**: Laws treat possession of intimate photos of under 18 as criminal, even if consensual between teens.

> "Possessing an intimate photo of anyone under 18 can now result in a prison sentence... Teens laugh at lectures from school teachers not to take or share such photos."

**Consequences for Teenagers**:
- Can be tricked into sharing images
- Recipients commit crimes by simply having the photos on their phones
- Leads to bullying and intimate partner abuse

---

### Intimate Relationship Abuse (Stalkerware)

#### Key Issues with Stalkerware Apps
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Poor Information Security** | Many apps have security flaws that allow attackers to bypass protections. |
| **Marketing Practices** | Explicitly marketed to abusive men for monitoring partners/ex-partners. |
| **Legal Status in Europe/Canada** | Illegal under current laws, but still available on app stores. |

> "Over half of abusers tracked women using stalkerware [in the US and Canada]."

---

## Section 9: Summary of Threat Models

### Four Categories of Attackers
1. **Spies**: Government actors focused on espionage (e.g., NSA)
2. **Crooks**: Criminals motivated by financial gain (cybercrime ecosystem)
3. **Geeks**: Researchers who find vulnerabilities and report them responsibly
4. **Bullies**: Individuals or groups committing abuse against persons

| Category | Primary Motivation | Typical Targets | Key Tools |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Spies | National security, espionage | Foreign governments, dissidents | Malware for persistent access, network exploitation |
| Crooks | Financial gain | Mass market of vulnerable systems | Botnets, phishing kits, ransomware-as-a-service |
| Geeks | Curiosity, professional acclaim | Software vendors (to report bugs) | Vulnerability research tools |
| Bullies | Personal vendetta or ideological reasons | Individuals in personal relationships | Social media harassment campaigns |

> "Not all threat actors are bad: many hackers report bugs responsibly and many whistleblowers are public-spirited."

---

### Key Takeaways for Security Designers
1. **Don't rely solely on patching**: Need to monitor networks continuously.
2. **Plan incident response procedures**:
   - Know who to call for forensics (don't leave CEO "gasping like a landed fish in front of TV cameras")
3. **Implement essential controls**:
   - Backups to recover from ransomware
   - Payment procedure safeguards against business email compromise

> "If you're defending a company of any size, you'll see enough machines on your network getting infected... You need to watch your network and keep good enough logs."
