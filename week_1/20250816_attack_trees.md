# Comprehensive Study Notes: Attack Trees  
**Based on Bruce Schneier, "Modeling Security Threats," *Dr. Dobb’s Journal*, December 1999**

---

## **I. Introduction to Security Misconceptions**
### Core Problem Statement
- **Security is not absolute**: Marketing claims like *"hacker-proof software"* or *"triple-DES security"* are misleading because:
  - Unbreakable systems *are* broken (e.g., strong cryptography fails via side-channel attacks).
  - Attacks evolve beyond initial design assumptions.
  - Security requires context:  
    > **"Secure from whom? Secure for how long?"**  

### Why Traditional Approaches Fail
| Approach          | Flaw                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Algorithm-centric | Focuses on math (e.g., key length) while ignoring human/environmental factors. |
| Marketing claims  | Ignores real-world attack vectors and attacker capabilities.           |

> **Key Insight**: Security is a *process*, not a product.

---

## **II. Attack Trees: Core Concepts & Structure**
### Definition
- A **formal, methodical framework** for modeling security threats by representing attacks as hierarchical trees.
- **Goal**: Systematically identify all possible attack paths to design effective countermeasures.

### Tree Anatomy (Figure 1)
| Node Type | Symbol | Meaning                                                                 | Example from Safe Attack Tree                     |
|-----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Root**  |        | Ultimate goal of the attacker                                           | *Open the safe*                                  |
| **Leaf**  |        | Atomic attack step (no further decomposition)                           | *Pick lock*, *Learn combination written down*    |
| **OR Node** | ∨      | Alternatives: *Any one child achieves subgoal*.                         | Four ways to open a safe (`pick`, `learn combo`, `cut`, `improper install`) |
| **AND Node**| ∧      | Sequential steps: *All children must be achieved for subgoal*.           | *Eavesdrop on conversation* **AND** *Get owner to say combination* |

> 💡 **Critical Distinction**:  
> - OR nodes = "Choose one path" (e.g., *"How can I open the safe? Pick it, or learn combo..."*)  
> - AND nodes = "Must do all steps" (e.g., *"To steal data: intercept traffic AND decrypt message"*).

---

## **III. Value Assignment & Propagation**
### A. Boolean Values
#### Rules for Propagation:
| Node Type | Rule                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OR**    | `Possible` if *any child is possible*; `Impossible` only if *all children impossible*. |
| **AND**   | `Possible` only if *all children are possible*; `Impossible` if *any child impossible*. |

#### Example (Figure 2):
- **Goal**: Open safe → `Possible` because:  
  - OR node with two paths: `(Cut open = P) ∨ (Bribe owner = P)` → Root is `P`.
- **Dotted lines** show all possible attack chains.

> 💡 **Why Boolean?** Quickly identifies *vulnerable paths* for defense focus.  

#### Table: Value Propagation Comparison
| Node Type | Example Input Values      | Output Value |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| OR        | `P, I, P`                 | `P` (any possible) |
| AND       | `P, P, I`                 | `I` (all must be possible) |

---

### B. Continuous Values
#### Rules for Propagation:
- **OR Node**: Value = *Cheapest child*.
- **AND Node**: Value = *Sum of children’s values*.

#### Example (Figure 4):
| Leaf Node               | Cost   |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Cut open safe           | $50,000 |
| Learn combo from written note | $10,000 |
| Bribe owner             | $20,000 |

- **OR node (Learn combo)**: `min($10k, $20k) = $10k`  
- **AND node (Eavesdrop + Get combination)**: `$5k (eavesdrop) + $3k (get combo) = $8k`  
- **Root cost**: `min($50k, $10k, $8k) = $8k`

#### Figure 5 Application:
> "If safe contents are worth <$100k, defend against attacks costing ≤$100k."  
> → *Only focus on paths with total cost < $100k* (e.g., cut open at $50k).

---

### C. Multi-Attribute Analysis
Attack trees support **combining multiple values** to answer nuanced questions:
| Query                                      | Example from Figure 6                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cheapest attack requiring no special equipment? | `Bribe owner ($20k) > Cut open ($50k)` → *Cut open* is cheaper with **no tools needed**. |
| Most likely legal attack?                  | *Social engineering (e.g., bribing)* may be illegal; *keylogger* might not require breaking laws. |

> 💡 **Strategic Insight**: Attack trees reveal that "security" depends on attacker profile:  
> - Organized crime → Focus on expensive attacks ($10k+).  
> - Terrorists → Focus on high-risk, low-cost (e.g., $5k) attacks.  
> - Graduate students → Ignore illegal paths (bribery/blackmail).

## **IV. Case Study: PGP Attack Tree (Figure 7)**
### Goal
- *Read a message encrypted with PGP*.

### Key Insight from the Tree:
| Common Misconception          | Reality (from Attack Tree)                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Stronger encryption = more secure" | **Breaking RSA/IDEA is not the easiest path**. Easier attacks exist: <br> - Capture screen during decryption (`Back Orifice`)<br> - Steal private key after passphrase entry<br> - Recover passphrase via keyboard sniffer |
| Focus on algorithm strength   | PGP’s security depends more on **user environment and implementation** than encryption math. |

### Why This Matters:
- Increasing RSA from 1024-bit to 2048-bit is like "putting a stake in the ground" (ineffective vs. building a palisade around real threats).
- Attack tree shows:  
  > **95% of attacks bypass cryptography entirely** via user/system vulnerabilities.

---

## **V. Creating an Attack Tree**
### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Define goals**: Identify *specific* attacker objectives (e.g., "read PGP message," "forge signature").
2. **Brainstorm attacks**: For each goal, list all possible paths to achieve it.
3. **Decompose recursively**: Break down complex steps into subgoals until reaching leaf nodes (atomic actions).
4. **Validate with peers**: Have others add missing attack vectors ("*What did I miss?*").
5. **Assign values**: Research costs/probabilities for each node (values change over time).

> ⚠️ **Critical Note**:  
> "There’s always a chance you forgot an attack, but practice improves accuracy."

## **VI. Strategic Applications of Attack Trees**
### A. Security Decision-Making
| Use Case                                  | How Attack Tree Helps                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assess system vulnerability               | Check root node value (e.g., "Is reading PGP messages possible?").                  |
| Evaluate countermeasures ("What if?")     | *Example*: If bribing owner costs $80k instead of $20k, new root cost = **$60k**.    |
| Identify security assumptions             | *PGP assumes no one can bribe programmers*.                                         |
| Compare attacks                           | "Which is cheaper: brute-forcing passphrase ($5k) or stealing key via virus ($10k)?". |

### B. Scalability & Reusability (Figure 8)
- **Attack trees are modular**:  
  - PGP attack tree → Subtree in larger system tree.
  - Safe-cracking tree → Subtree for "read message" goal.
- **Benefits**:
  - Security experts don’t need deep knowledge of *every* subsystem (e.g., safe mechanics).
  - Organizations reuse trees across projects ("library of threat models").
  > *"For national security agencies, this enables compartmentalized expertise."*

## **VII. Conclusion & Key Takeaways**
### Why Attack Trees Transform Security Analysis
| Traditional Approach          | Attack Tree Approach                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Focuses on *math* (e.g., key length) | Focuses on *real-world attack paths*.                |
| Ignores attacker capabilities  | Integrates **attacker profile** into analysis.        |
| Static ("this is secure")      | Dynamic: Updates as new attacks emerge or countermeasures change. |

### Core Principles
1. **Security = Process**: Attack trees enable continuous threat modeling.
2. **Context matters**: "Secure" depends on *who* you’re defending against and *what’s at stake*.
3. **Human factor dominates**: 90% of attacks exploit people/systems, not math.

## **VIII. Comprehensive Summary Table**
| Concept                 | Definition                                                                 | Example                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **OR Node**             | Attack path: *Any one alternative* achieves goal.                          | Open safe via `lockpick` OR `cut open`.   |
| **AND Node**            | Attack requires *all steps*.                                               | Eavesdrop conversation AND get combo from owner. |
| **Boolean Propagation** | OR = any child possible → root possible; AND = all children must be possible. | Root: `P` if at least one path is `P`.   |
| **Continuous Value**    | Cost/probability assigned to nodes (e.g., $, % success rate).              | Cheapest attack cost = min(OR child costs). |
| **PGP Insight**         | Encryption strength irrelevant vs. user environment vulnerabilities.       | Keylogger > RSA brute-force for PGP access. |

## **IX. 15-20 Study Questions (Exam Focus)**
### Conceptual
1. Why is "hacker-proof software" a misleading marketing claim?  
2. Explain the difference between an OR node and AND node in attack trees with examples.  
3. How does value propagation differ for Boolean vs. continuous nodes? Provide formulas.  

### Application-Based
4. Given leaf costs: `Cut open = $50k`, `Learn combo from note = $10k`, `Bribe owner = $20k` (OR node), what is the root cost?  
5. If an AND node has children costing `$3k` and `$7k`, what is its total value?  
6. For a safe with contents worth **$80,000**, which attacks must be defended against based on Figure 5?  

### Critical Analysis
7. Why does Schneier argue that PGP’s security depends more on user environment than encryption strength?  
8. How would an attack tree change if the attacker is a "bored graduate student" vs. "organized crime"?  
9. What strategic error do companies make by focusing solely on cryptographic key length (e.g., 1024-bit vs. 2048-bit RSA)?  

### Creation & Strategy
10. Describe *three steps* in creating a robust attack tree, emphasizing validation.  
11. How does the scalability of attack trees benefit large organizations? Give an example from Figure 8.  
12. If implementing a countermeasure increases bribery cost from $20k to $80k (Figure 6), how is root value affected?  

### Advanced
13. Why might "most likely legal attack" be more relevant than "cheapest attack" for corporate security?  
14. How would you use an attack tree to assess vulnerability against *state-sponsored attackers* vs. *script kiddies*?  
15. What is the primary limitation of using only Boolean values in attack trees (vs. continuous)?  

### Bonus: Real-World Connection
16. Name a real-world breach where attackers exploited user/system vulnerabilities instead of cryptography (e.g., Target 2013). How would an attack tree have revealed this?  
17. Why is "security assumptions" critical to document in an attack tree? Give a PGP example.

> **Final Note for Mastery**: Attack trees are not just diagrams—they’re *decision-making tools*. The true test of mastery is applying them to dissect real systems (e.g., "Why did the SolarWinds breach succeed?" → Map attacker paths using OR/AND nodes).
