# Week 7: Lecture 7 - Side Channel Attacks and Secure Code Review

## Overview
This lecture covers **side channel attacks** (particularly Meltdown and Spectre), their underlying mechanisms, and how they exploit micro-architectural features of modern processors. The second part introduces **secure code review techniques**, including static analysis, dynamic testing, and mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities like timing side channels.

---

## Understanding Side Channel Attacks

### What Are Side Channel Attacks?
> Side channel attacks don't directly target the system's core functionality but instead exploit **indirect information leakage** from physical implementation details. Attackers observe characteristics like *timing*, *power consumption*, or *sound* to infer sensitive data without direct access.

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The most dangerous vulnerabilities often happen when everything appears correct at the architectural level, but micro-architectural features leak information."

*Student Question*: "How can timing really reveal secrets?"
*Instructor Response*: "Imagine checking a library bookshelf: if you hear which books are missing (fast access), you know what was borrowed. Similarly, fast memory access reveals what data was recently used."

---

### Why Timing Attacks Work: Computer Architecture Fundamentals

Modern processors prioritize **speed** through architectural features that create timing differences:

| Component | Access Time | Speed Relative to CPU |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Registers | ~1 cycle    | Fastest (closest to CPU) |
| L1 Cache  | ~4 cycles   | Very fast            |
| L2 Cache  | ~10 cycles  | Fast                 |
| Main Memory | ~100-300 cycles | Slow              |
| Disk      | ~10,000+ cycles | Very slow         |

*Key Insight*: "Memory latency hasn't improved much since the Pentium 4 (2004), so processors use **caches** and **speculative execution** to compensate."

#### Memory Hierarchy & Access Times
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[CPU] --> B[L1 Cache]
    B --> C[L2 Cache]
    C --> D[Main Memory/DRAM]
    D --> E[Disk/SSD]
```

*Instructor Insight*: "When you access data, the CPU first checks cache (fast), then main memory (slower), then disk (very slow). The key is that **repeated accesses to the same location are faster** because it's cached."

---

## How Side Channel Attacks Exploit Processor Architecture

### 1. Memory Caches & Timing Differences
Modern processors use caches to store recently accessed data in fast memory.

*Example*: 
- First access: Slow (from main memory)
- Second access: Fast (from cache)

This timing difference is the foundation for **Flush+Reload** attacks.

#### Flush+Reload Attack Process
1. **Flush**: Clear all cached data from a shared array (`detectArray`)
2. **Wait**: Let victim application execute code that accesses sensitive data
3. **Reload**: Check access times to detect which cache lines were accessed

```c
char detectArray[256 * 64];
flush_cache(detectArray); // Clear all entries

try {
    char a = *kernel_address;   // Victim executes this (accesses kernel memory)
    detectArray[a * 64]++;      // Triggers cache access
} catch (segfault) {}           // Will fail but cache may be updated

// Check which cache lines are now in cache
for (int i = 0; i < 256; ++i) {
    if (is_in_cache(detectArray[i * 64])) 
        printf("Secret byte was %d\n", i);
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "The attacker doesn't know which memory location holds the secret, but by checking all possibilities and seeing which access is fast, they infer what value was accessed."

---

### 2. Speculative Execution & Micro-Architectural Leaks

Processors use **speculative execution** to improve performance:
- Predict branch outcomes (e.g., "if" statements)
- Execute instructions before knowing if they're needed
- Discard results if prediction is wrong

*Example*: 
```c
a = constant_value;
b = slow_to_obtain();  // Could be a memory access
c = f(a);              // Can start before b finishes
if (uncached_value == 1) {
    compute_something(); // Speculatively executed if prediction is correct
}
```

*Key Insight*: "The CPU makes 'mistakes' by executing instructions speculatively, then discards them. But **the cache state changes** during speculationâ€”this leak is what side channel attacks exploit."

---

## Meltdown Vulnerability

### How Meltdown Works
Meltdown exploits a flaw in Intel processors where:
1. User-space code can access kernel memory (normally protected)
2. The CPU doesn't check permissions *before* caching data
3. Attackers use **Flush+Reload** to extract sensitive data from kernel memory

#### Technical Details
- **Vulnerable CPUs**: Mostly Intel x86-64 (not AMD, which checks earlier at TLB access)
- **Attack Speed**: Up to 500 KB/s
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Map less of protected kernel space in user processes
  - Patches like KAISER/KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation)

*Instructor Insight*: "Meltdown is dangerous because it affects *bug-free OSes*. It's a micro-architectural flaw below the OS level."

---

## Spectre Vulnerability

Spectre exploits **speculative execution** to bypass security checks, with two main variants:

### Spectre v1: Bounds Check Bypass
*How it works*: 
1. Train CPU branch predictor using valid array accesses (0-15)
2. Force out-of-bounds access (`x = &secret - array1`)
3. Speculative execution executes code that leaks secret via cache

```c
unsigned int array1_size = 16;
unsigned char array1[16];
unsigned char array2[256 * 4096]; // Cache line-aligned
char secret = 'S';

void victim(size_t x) {
    if (x < array1_size) { 
        unsigned char value = array1[x];      // Safe access
        unsigned char temp = array2[value*4096]; // Leaks via cache
    }
}
```

*Attack sequence*: 
- Train CPU with `x=0..15`
- Call victim with malicious `x` (out of bounds)
- Speculative execution accesses secret value
- Flush+Reload reveals 'S' by checking which cache line is fast

### Spectre v2: Branch Target Injection
*How it works*: 
1. Poison branch target buffer to redirect speculative execution
2. Force CPU to jump to "gadget" function that leaks data
3. Use cache timing to extract secret value

```c
void (*func_ptr)() = safe_func; // Normal pointer

// Attacker poisons BTB to point here:
void gadget() {
    unsigned char secret = *secret_ptr;
    temp = array2[secret*4096]; // Leaks via cache
}

void victim() {
    func_ptr(); // Speculatively jumps to gadget()
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "Spectre is harder to exploit than Meltdown but also **harder to mitigate** because it requires trade-offs between security and performance."

## Comparison: Meltdown vs Spectre

| Feature | Meltdown | Spectre |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Target** | Kernel memory (protected) | Any memory (including sandboxed apps) |
| **Vulnerable CPUs** | Intel x86-64, some Apple chips | All CPU types (Intel, AMD, ARM) |
| **Exploitation Method** | Cache timing + out-of-order execution | Branch prediction + speculative execution |
| **Mitigation Difficulty** | Moderate (OS patches exist) | High (requires performance trade-offs) |

*Instructor Emphasis*: "Spectre is scarier because it can leak data from *other applications running in your browser*, like passwords or cookies."

---

## Application-Level Side Channel Attacks

### 1. Unsafe Comparison Timing
Many languages use **non-constant-time comparison** (e.g., `==`):

```python
# Vulnerable: Stops at first mismatch
def compare(a, b):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] != b[i]:
            return False
    return True

# Secure alternative:
if constant_time_compare(a, b):  # Always takes same time
```

*Why it matters*: 
- If password `a` matches first character of correct password but not second â†’ fast response (1 cycle)
- If password matches all characters except last â†’ slow response (N cycles)

*Instructor Insight*: "Attackers can use this to guess passwords in *minutes* instead of years with brute force."

---

### 2. User Enumeration Timing
Attackers exploit timing differences between:
- Valid username + invalid password: **Longer time** (checks password)
- Invalid username + invalid password: **Shorter time**

```python
# Vulnerable code:
def authenticate(username, password):
    if not user_exists(username): 
        return False  # Short response
    if verify_password(password): 
        return True   # Long response
```

*Mitigation Strategies*:
1. **Never stop abruptly**: Always process all checks (e.g., check password even for invalid usernames)
2. **Add random delay**: Wait 200ms-3s before responding

```python
def authenticate(username, password):
    if not user_exists(username): 
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.2, 3.0)) # Add randomness
    return verify_password(password) # Always takes same time
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why some sites respond with 'Invalid username or password'â€”it hides the timing difference."

## Secure Code Review Techniques

### Static vs Dynamic Analysis

| Technique | How It Works | Strengths | Limitations |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Static Analysis** | Analyzes code *without execution* (source code only) | Fast, scalable, finds pattern-based issues | False positives/negatives possible |
| **Dynamic Analysis** | Observes program behavior *at runtime* | Reveals real vulnerabilities | Resource-intensive, not exhaustive |

*Instructor Insight*: "Static analysis tools can detect >65% of defects before testing beginsâ€”saving teams 500% more time."

---

### Key Code Review Practices

#### Manual Code Review
- **Validation**: Are we building the *right system*? (Meets user needs)
- **Verification**: Are we building the *system right*? (Follows design/specs)
- **Challenges**: Time-consuming, requires expertise

#### Static Analysis Tools
- **Purpose**: Find vulnerabilities with well-defined patterns (input validation issues, unsafe functions)
- **Examples**:
  - Java: `MessageDigest.isEqual()`
  - Python: `hmac.compare_digest()`
  - C/C++: Self-implemented constant-time comparison

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The OWASP Top 10 is the *defacto security standard for developers*. You must know these threats."

---

## Real-World Impact & Statistics

| Finding | Statistic |
|---------|-----------|
| **Defect Removal Efficiency** | Best practices achieve >99% defect removal |
| **Cost Reduction** | Static analysis + peer review reduces costs by 50% |
| **Time Spent on Bugs** | Developers spend ~50% of time fixing bugs, not coding |
| **Testing Effectiveness** | Combined testing finds only ~85% of defects |

*Instructor Insight*: "The most expensive bug in history was a single missing semicolon in NASA's softwareâ€”costing $125 million."

## Practical Exercise

**Scenario**: You're developing a login system with the following code:

```python
def verify_password(username, password):
    if username not in users:
        return False  # Fast response for invalid user
    correct_pw = users[username]
    return password == correct_pw  # Slow for valid user
```

**Task**: 
1. Explain why this is vulnerable to timing attacks.
2. Rewrite the code using constant-time comparison (use `hmac.compare_digest`).
3. Add a random delay of 0.5-2 seconds before returning results.

*Hint*: Always process all checks, then return result after fixed time.
