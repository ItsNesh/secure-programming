I need to create comprehensive lecture notes for a student who missed class on Week 5: Lecture 5 about Heap vulnerabilities, exploit mitigations (NX, Stack Canaries, ASLR), with all information from both slides and transcript.

Let me organize the content by going through each slide and the transcript to synthesize everything into flowing educational notes.

First, I'll structure the document as requested:
- H1 title
- Overview section
- Hierarchical headers for organization
- Key insights from transcript formatted properly
- Summary at the end

I need to include all key concepts, examples, explanations, algorithms, calculations, and insights from both sources without copying verbatim.

Let me start by identifying all the main topics covered:

1. Heap Management & Vulnerabilities (Slides 3-6)
2. Heap Overflow/Underflow, Use After Free, Double Free, Memory Leaks (Slide 4)
3. C++ vtables as a target for heap vulnerabilities (Slides 12-18)
4. Defending Against Memory Safety Vulnerabilities (Slide 20)
5. Exploit Mitigations: NX, Stack Canaries, ASLR (Slides 21-86)

Now I'll synthesize the content from both slides and transcript into flowing educational notes.

Let me start by creating a comprehensive title:

# Week 5: Secure Programming - Heap Vulnerabilities & Exploit Mitigations

Then an overview section that captures what this lecture is about.

I need to include all key concepts, examples, explanations, algorithms, calculations, etc. from both sources.

From the transcript, I can see important insights like:
- The analogy of canaries in coal mines for stack canaries
- Explanation of how heap memory works compared to stack
- Real-world example of a heap vulnerability in Google Chrome (CVE-2025-5419)
- Detailed explanation of return-to-libc and ROP attacks

Let me organize this into the required structure.

I'll create sections for:
- Heap Management Fundamentals
- Heap Vulnerabilities (with examples from C++ vtables)
- Exploit Mitigations (NX, Stack Canaries, ASLR) with detailed explanations of how they work and how to bypass them

For each section, I'll synthesize the slide content with transcript insights.

Let me start drafting:

# Week 5: Secure Programming - Heap Vulnerabilities & Exploit Mitigations

## Overview
This lecture explores heap memory management vulnerabilities and modern exploit mitigations. We examine common heap-related bugs (overflow/underflow, use-after-free), analyze how C++ vtables can be targeted in heap attacks, and study key defenses including Non-Executable Pages (NX), Stack Canaries, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The lecture emphasizes that while these mitigations significantly increase attack difficulty, they are not foolproof - attackers have developed techniques to bypass them.

Now I'll create the detailed content sections...

For Heap Management Fundamentals:
- From slides: Slide 6 about heap vs stack memory layout
- From transcript: Explanation of how heap is managed with break pointer and malloc/free

I need to explain this clearly, including:
- How heap grows from lower addresses to higher addresses (left to right)
- The role of the "break" pointer that marks the end of the heap
- How malloc() uses sbrk()/brk() to move the break pointer
- How free() returns memory to a freelist for reuse

For Heap Vulnerabilities:
- From slides: Slide 4 about different types, Slide 19 on heap overflow and use-after-free
- From transcript: Detailed explanation of C++ vtables as targets

I'll explain how attackers can target:
- Function pointers (as in the example with add/sub functions)
- C++ vtable pointers (with detailed explanation from slides 12-18)

For Exploit Mitigations:
- NX/DEP/W^X: How non-executable pages prevent shellcode execution
- Stack Canaries: The canary-in-the-coal-mine analogy and how they work
- ASLR: Randomizing memory layout to make exploits harder

And for each mitigation, I'll include:
- How it works (from slides)
- How attackers bypass them (from transcript)
- Practical examples of attacks that circumvent these mitigations

Let me create the detailed content now...

I need to be careful not to copy verbatim from either source - I need to rephrase and synthesize for clarity.

For example, instead of just saying "Heap overflow: Overwrite vtable pointer," I'll explain:
- What a heap overflow is
- How it differs from stack overflow
- Why the vtable pointer is vulnerable (because it's stored in memory near user-controlled buffers)
- A step-by-step explanation with an analogy

I'll also include all key examples mentioned, like:
- The Google Chrome CVE example
- Return-to-libc attack details
- ROP chain construction

Let me create a comprehensive set of notes that flows naturally while including every important detail from both sources.

Now I'll start writing the detailed content following the structure requirements.

# Week 5: Secure Programming - Heap Vulnerabilities & Exploit Mitigations

## Overview
This lecture explores heap memory management vulnerabilities and modern exploit mitigations. We examine common heap-related bugs (overflow/underflow, use-after-free), analyze how C++ vtables can be targeted in heap attacks, and study key defenses including Non-Executable Pages (NX), Stack Canaries, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The lecture emphasizes that while these mitigations significantly increase attack difficulty, they are not foolproof - attackers have developed techniques to bypass them. We'll explore both the theoretical foundations of these vulnerabilities and practical exploitation techniques.

## Heap Memory Management Fundamentals

### Understanding Heap Structure
Heap memory is a dynamically allocated region in program memory used for storing data structures that require runtime allocation (unlike stack, which has automatic management). Unlike stack memory, heap requires manual management by developers using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. 

The key structural elements of memory layout include:

| Memory Segment | Purpose | Growth Direction |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| **Stack**      | Function call frames, local variables | Grows downward (higher addresses to lower) |
| **Heap**       | Dynamically allocated objects | Grows upward (lower addresses to higher) |
| **Data**       | Initialized global/static variables | Fixed location |
| **BSS**        | Uninitialized global/static variables | Fixed location |
| **Code**       | Executable instructions | Fixed location |

The *break pointer* marks the boundary between heap and other memory segments. At program startup, the break is typically positioned at the end of the BSS segment (uninitialized data). When `malloc()` requests memory, it moves the break pointer to allocate space; when `free()` releases memory, it makes that space available for reuse.

### Heap Allocation Strategy
Heap management systems often use *freelist-based allocators*:
- A linked list tracks free chunks in the heap
- `malloc()` selects a suitable chunk from the freelist (or uses `sbrk()` to extend the heap)
- Each allocated chunk includes a header containing size information

To optimize performance, many systems implement *size-specific freelists*, where memory is rounded up to predefined sizes. This avoids linear search through all free chunks and enables efficient allocation for common request sizes.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "Heap management requires manual effort by developers, unlike stack which the OS manages automatically. This human element introduces vulnerabilities because it's error-prone."

*Instructor Emphasis*: The heap is where most memory-related bugs occur in real-world applications due to this manual management requirement.

## Heap Vulnerabilities: Exploiting Memory Management

### Common Heap-Related Bugs
Heap vulnerabilities arise from improper memory management and include:

| Vulnerability Type | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Heap Overflow** | Writing beyond allocated buffer boundaries into adjacent heap chunks |
| **Use After Free** | Accessing memory after it has been freed (via `free()` or `delete`) |
| **Double/Invalid Free** | Frees a chunk more than once or frees unallocated memory |
| **Memory Leak** | Failure to release unused memory, causing gradual resource exhaustion |

> **Real-World Example**: The transcript highlighted CVE-2025-5419 (a critical heap corruption vulnerability in Google Chrome with a CVSS score of 8.8), demonstrating that these vulnerabilities remain prevalent even in modern software.

### Targeting Function Pointers
Attackers often target pointers to executable code rather than just return addresses:

```c
int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
int sub(int a, int b) { return a - b; }

int main() {
    char op = 'a';
    int x = 2, y = 1;
    int (*fn)(int,int); // Function pointer
    
    if (op == 'a') fn = add;
    else fn = sub;
    
    printf("Result: %d", fn(x,y));
}
```

Here, an attacker could overwrite the `fn` function pointer to point to malicious code instead of `add()` or `sub()`. This demonstrates that *any* pointer used for control flow can be a target.

### C++ vtable Exploitation
C++ objects use **vtables** (virtual method tables) for polymorphism, where each object contains a pointer to its class's vtable. The vtable stores function pointers:

```
Heap Structure:
[Instance Variables of Object X] → [Vtable Pointer]
[Instance Variables of Object Y] → [Vtable Pointer]

Vtable Structure:
Address of Method bar
Address of Method foo
...
```

Attackers can exploit heap overflows to overwrite the vtable pointer. For example:

1. Overflow a buffer in object `X` (which is adjacent to object `Y`)
2. Overwrite `Y`'s vtable pointer with an address pointing to attacker-controlled shellcode
3. When `Y` calls method `foo()`, it executes the attacker's code

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "In C++, objects are stored in heap memory, and their methods are called through vtables. Attackers can target these vtable pointers just like they target return addresses on the stack."

*Practical Example*: The transcript explained that attackers could overwrite a buffer near an object's instance variables to reach its vtable pointer (which is typically at the beginning of the object), then redirect execution to malicious code.

## Exploit Mitigation Strategies

### Non-Executable Pages (NX/DEP/W^X)

#### How It Works
Modern systems implement **W^X** (Write XOR Execute) memory protection:
- Stack, heap, and data segments: Writable but not executable
- Code segment: Executable but not writable
- Implemented via hardware page table entries with "executable" and "writable" bits

This prevents attackers from executing shellcode placed on the stack or in heap memory.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "The stack is only used for data, so there's no need to run code from it. The MMU can prevent execution based on address."

*Instructor Emphasis*: This mitigation has near-zero overhead because it uses hardware features (the page table) rather than software checks.

#### Bypass Techniques: Return-to-libc
Attackers bypass non-executable pages by reusing existing executable code:

```c
void vulnerable(void) {
    char name[20];
    gets(name); // Vulnerable to overflow
}
```

Instead of injecting shellcode, attackers overwrite the return address with a pointer to `system()` in libc:
- Overwrite buffer with: `'A'*24 + [address_of_system] + 'B'*4 + [address_of_string]`
- The string `"rm -rf /"` is placed after the buffer
- When `gets()` returns, it jumps to `system()`, which executes the command

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "The attacker doesn't need to inject code; they just redirect execution to existing functions."

*Practical Example*: Using `system("rm -rf /")` demonstrates how attackers can leverage standard library functions for malicious purposes without injecting executable code.

#### Bypass Technique: Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)
When specific function calls aren't available, attackers chain together small instruction sequences ("gadgets"):

```assembly
foo:
    addl $4, %esp   ; Cleanup stack
    xorl %eax, %ebx ; XOR operation
    ret             ; Jump to next gadget

bar:
    andl $1, %edx   ; AND operation
    movl $1, %eax   ; Move value into register
    ret             ; Jump to next gadget
```

Attackers construct a ROP chain by overwriting return addresses with pointers to these gadgets:

- First address: `&bar + 25` (starts at the "mov" instruction)
- Second address: `&foo + 10` (starts at the "xor" instruction)

This creates an execution sequence that performs operations without needing executable memory.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "ROP chains can be automatically generated by tools based on a target binary and desired malicious code."

*Instructor Emphasis*: "Non-executable pages aren't a huge issue for attackers anymore. Having writable and executable pages makes things easier, but not that much easier."

---

### Stack Canaries

#### How It Works
Stack canaries are sacrificial values placed between the buffer and sensitive data (return address):

1. Generate random value at program start
2. Place it on stack below return address during function entry
3. Verify its integrity before returning from a function

```c
vulnerable(void) {
    char name[20];
    gets(name); // Vulnerable to overflow
}
```

The canary is placed between `name` and the saved frame pointer/return address:

```
Stack Frame:
... (previous frames)
[Canary] → [Saved EBP] → [Return Address]
[name buffer]
```

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The first byte of a stack canary is always NULL to prevent string-based leaks."

#### Bypass Techniques
Attackers bypass stack canaries through:

1. **Leaking the Canary**: Using format string vulnerabilities to print stack values (e.g., `%x`), then overwriting with itself.
2. **Bypassing via Non-Sequential Writes**: Exploiting functions that write non-consecutively on the stack (e.g., heap overflows, vtable exploits).
3. **Brute Force Guessing**:
   - 32-bit systems: 24 bits to guess (16 million possibilities)
   - 64-bit systems: 56 bits to guess (72 quadrillion possibilities)

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "The canary is like a coal mine canary—sacrificial but provides early warning when changed."

*Practical Example*: The transcript used the analogy of miners using canaries in coal mines as an early warning system for toxic gas. Similarly, stack canaries provide an early warning that memory has been corrupted.

#### Feasibility of Brute Force
| System | Bits to Guess | Possible Values | Time (10k attempts/sec) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 32-bit | 24 bits       | ~16 million     | ~30 minutes             |
| 64-bit | 56 bits       | ~72 quadrillion | ~32 years (with no timeout) |

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The feasibility depends on your threat model—remote servers with timeouts make brute force impractical."

---

### Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

#### How It Works
ASLR randomizes the memory layout of key segments:
- **Stack**: Randomized location each run
- **Heap**: Randomized location each run
- **Code/Shared Libraries**: Randomized locations

This prevents attackers from knowing where shellcode or specific functions are located.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "Traditional exploits need precise addresses (stack-based overflows, return-to-libc), but ASLR randomizes these."

*Instructor Emphasis*: "ASLR is most effective when combined with other mitigations like NX and stack canaries."

#### Bypass Techniques
Attackers bypass ASLR through:

1. **Leaking Pointers**: Using format string vulnerabilities to leak addresses (e.g., `printf(dest)` where `dest` contains a pointer).
2. **Relative Addressing**: Knowing the relative position of data within segments:
   - If you know the stack frame pointer address, you can compute other values
   - Example: Secret variable is 4 bytes below the saved EBP

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "The attacker doesn't need to guess the absolute location—they just need to find a reference point and calculate relative positions."

*Practical Example*: The transcript demonstrated how attackers could leak stack pointer addresses using format string vulnerabilities, then use those to compute the address of sensitive data.

#### Brute Force Attack
Attackers can attempt brute force by:
1. Guessing the base address (e.g., 12-bit page offset)
2. Using NOP sleds to increase success rate

```
Memory Layout with ASLR:
[Unused] [Stack] [Unused] [Heap] [Unused] [Data] [Unused] [Code]
```

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "ASLR makes it much harder for attackers because they can't know where shellcode will be."

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The combination of ASLR, NX, and stack canaries creates a multi-layered defense that significantly increases attack complexity."

---

## Summary: Exploit Mitigation Effectiveness

| Mitigation | How It Works | Primary Bypass Technique |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **NX/DEP** | Makes memory non-executable (W^X) | Return-to-libc, ROP chains |
| **Stack Canaries** | Sacrificial value between buffer and return address | Canary leakage, brute force |
| **ASLR** | Randomizes memory layout of key segments | Pointer leaks, relative addressing |

> **Key Insight from Transcript**: "No single mitigation is perfect. The most effective defense combines multiple techniques."

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The best approach to security isn't relying on one technique—it's using a layered defense strategy where each layer makes the attack harder."

## Key Takeaways

1. Heap vulnerabilities arise from improper memory management (overflow, use-after-free) and target pointers used for control flow.
2. C++ vtable exploitation demonstrates how heap overflows can redirect execution to malicious code.
3. **NX/DEP** prevents shellcode execution but is bypassed via return-to-libc and ROP chains.
4. **Stack Canaries** detect buffer overflows by verifying a sacrificial value, but can be bypassed through leakage or brute force.
5. **ASLR** randomizes memory layout to prevent precise address targeting, but can be circumvented using pointer leaks.

> "The most effective security approach combines multiple mitigations—NX for non-executable code, stack canaries for buffer overflow detection, and ASLR for randomized memory layouts."

## Practical Exercise

**Scenario**: You're developing a C++ application with heap-allocated objects that use vtables for polymorphism.

**Task**: 
1. Identify potential heap overflow vulnerabilities in the following code:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void foo() { /* ... */ }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    char buffer[20];
    virtual void bar() { /* ... */ }
};
```

2. Explain how an attacker could exploit a buffer overflow in `Derived::buffer` to redirect execution through the vtable.
