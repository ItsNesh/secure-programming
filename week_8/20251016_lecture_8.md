# Week 8: Code Review for Software Security - Static Analysis vs AI

## Overview

This lecture explores program analysis techniques used to verify software security, with a focus on static analysis methods (both human-driven code review and automated SAST tools) and how artificial intelligence is beginning to transform this field. The instructor emphasizes that as software becomes increasingly embedded in all aspects of our lives ("software eating the world"), ensuring secure development practices has become critical for preventing catastrophic data breaches like those experienced by Optus and Medibank.

The lecture covers:
- Traditional manual code review processes
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) methodologies
- The capabilities and limitations of SAST tools
- Emerging AI approaches to security analysis
- Challenges in implementing AI-based vulnerability detection

## Program Analysis Fundamentals

### Understanding Program Analysis Types

Program analysis is the systematic examination of software behavior, which falls into two primary categories:

| Type | Description | Integration Point |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Static Analysis** | White-box analysis of source code *without* execution (examines program state space) | Early in SDLC ("shift left") |
| **Dynamic Analysis** | Black-box analysis of program behavior *during* runtime | Later in SDLC |

The key distinction is that static analysis examines the *potential* behavior through abstraction, while dynamic analysis observes actual execution. As one instructor noted: *"Static analysis cannot possibly examine everything... it cannot make evaluations based on the execution of those statements."*

### Why Program Analysis Matters

Software security failures have catastrophic consequences when exploited. For example:
- **Optus Data Breach (2022)**: Test network with unauthenticated API access allowed attackers to scrape 9.8 million user records by incrementing sequential IDs.
- **Medibank Data Breach (2022)**: Similar vulnerabilities led to compromise of 9.7 million users.

These breaches occurred due to simple failures in:
1. Proper authentication
2. Data anonymization
3. Secure data handling

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated, *"Every company is now a software company... Software skills are a valuable resource."*

## Manual Code Review: The Human Element

### What Is Secure Code Review?

Secure code review extends standard code reviews by adding security as the primary lens of analysis. It's not just about functionality but verifying:
- Proper security controls are present
- Controls work as intended
- Controls are invoked in appropriate places

> "Code review is a very common industry practice... secure code review is an enhancement to the standard code review practice."

### Why Human Review Works Best

According to AppSec 2015 survey data, manual code review was identified as *the most effective way* of identifying vulnerabilities compared to other methods:

| Method | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------|
| Manual Code Review | Highest (most vulnerabilities detected) |
| Source Code Scanning (SAST) | Moderate |
| Dynamic Analysis | Lower |
| Penetration Testing | Lowest |

The reason for this effectiveness is that humans provide **context-aware analysis**—they understand the business rules, sensitive data flows, and design decisions behind the code.

### Benefits Beyond Security

Secure code review provides multiple advantages:
- Ensures more than one person has seen each piece of code
- Forces developers to articulate and document security decisions
- Serves as a learning tool for junior developers
- Assists with familiarization of the codebase

> "The complexity of vulnerabilities and code bases means that a developer with proper understanding of the codebase has the best chance of finding flaws."

### Integrating Code Review into SDLC

Code review can be integrated at different points in the software development lifecycle:

| Integration Point | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-------------------|-------------|------|------|
| **Pre-Commit** | Review before merging to main branch | Prevents insecure code from entering deployment; strong preventative measure | Slows down development process |
| **Post-Commit** | Review after code is merged | Faster development cycle | May result in lower quality code requiring patches later |
| **Code Audits** | Thorough review outside regular development lifecycle | More thorough analysis, not impacting dev speed | Very expensive to conduct |

*Instructor Insight*: "The most prolific point of integration for code review is on a pull request or merge request. This is where it's a strong preventative measure because you're not letting unreviewed, insecure code ever enter your main deployment branch."

---

## Secure Code Review Checklist

A structured approach improves consistency and effectiveness:

### Core Security Areas to Check

| Category | Key Questions |
|----------|---------------|
| **Input Validation** | • Is all data from untrusted sources validated?<br>• Are input ranges and lengths properly checked? |
| **Access Control** | • Do access controls fail securely?<br>• Is access restricted to authorized users only? |
| **System Configuration** | • Are servers/frameworks running latest approved versions?<br>• Are service accounts restricted to least privileges? |
| **Error Handling & Logging** | • Are sensitive details (system info, session IDs) disclosed in errors? |

### OWASP Top 10: The Security Standard

The OWASP Top 10 provides the de facto standard for security threats developers should be aware of:

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
10. Server Side Request Forgery

> "The OWASP Top 10 is the standard for developers to be aware of and able to prevent security threats."

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

### What Is SAST?

> "Static analysis is the systematic examination of an abstraction of program state space."

Key characteristics:
- **White-box testing** with good code visibility
- Relies on pre-defined rules and checks
- Can be applied early as a preventative measure

*Instructor Emphasis*: "SAST tools are not perfect—they have high false positive rates, but they're useful for identifying potential issues that humans might miss."

### SAST Methods Explained

#### 1. Pattern Matching (Lexical Analysis)
Scans source code tokens for predefined insecure patterns.

> Example: In C programming, functions like `gets()` and `strcpy()` are considered insecure because they don't perform bounds checking. A pattern-matching tool would flag these as bad practices to replace with safer alternatives like `fgets()` or `strncpy()`.

#### 2. Data-Flow Analysis (DFA)
Tracks how data propagates through execution paths, focusing on sensitive operations.

> Example: Taint analysis identifies "sources" (untrusted inputs) and "sinks" (sensitive components). If untrusted input flows directly to a database sink, it's flagged as potentially vulnerable.

#### 3. Symbolic Execution
Uses symbolic values instead of concrete ones when program state is unknown, allowing data-flow analysis with symbolic expressions.

### SAST Example: Data-Flow Analysis

Let's analyze whether variable `x` could be zero in this code:

```c
x = 10;
y = x;
z = 0;
while (y > -1) {
    x = x / y;
    y = y - 1;
    z = 5;
}
```

**Analysis Process:**
- **Line 1:** `x = 10` → x is non-zero (NZ)
- **Line 2:** `y = x` → y is NZ
- **Line 3:** `z = 0` → z is zero (Z)

Now we enter the loop:
- **Loop Entry:** x=NZ, y=NZ, z=Z
- **Inside Loop:**
  - `x = x / y`: NZ/NZ = NZ
  - `y = y - 1`: NZ - 1 could be Z → becomes maybe zero (MZ)
  - `z = 5`: Z is now non-zero

After first loop iteration:
- x=NZ, y=MZ, z=MZ

Second loop iteration:
- `x = x / y`: NZ/MZ = NZ
- `y = y - 1`: MZ - 1 → still MZ
- `z = 5`: Z is now non-zero

Final state: 
- x=NZ, y=MZ, z=MZ

**Conclusion:** Since `y` could be zero (MZ), the division operation `x / y` represents a potential vulnerability.

*Instructor Insight*: "This example shows why static analysis can't perfectly track values—it's an abstraction. We don't know if the loop executes or what exact values are used, so we use this simplified tracking system."

### SAST Capabilities and Limitations

**Capabilities:**
- Defects from inconsistent design rules
- Security vulnerabilities (buffer overruns, unvalidated input)
- Memory errors (null dereference, uninitialized data)
- Resource leaks (memory, OS resources)
- API/framework rule violations
- Exceptions
- Encapsulation violations
- Race conditions

**Limitations:**
> "Static analysis cannot possibly examine everything... it cannot make evaluations based on the execution of those statements."

This means:
1. It can't account for compiler optimizations
2. Limited coverage (only checks predefined rules)
3. High false positive rates (over-flagging potential issues)

### SAST Integration Points

| Integration Point | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **IDE** | Scan source code during implementation; quick and lightweight |
| **Commit** | Scan modified changes when pushed to repository; pairs well with code review |
| **Deep Scan** | Full codebase scan (typically overnight); thorough but resource-intensive |
| **Integration** | Scan external code before integrating it into your project |

*Instructor Insight*: "For me as a scientist, I want SAST integrated as early as possible because I don't have much budget for higher-level security. IDE is where I like to integrate my SAST."

### Real-World Example: Pickle Vulnerability

**Vulnerability:** Using Python's `pickle` module for deserialization from untrusted sources.

```python
# Insecure example:
data = pickle.loads(untrusted_data)
```

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- `pickle` doesn't perform any checks when deserializing data
- Malicious payloads can execute arbitrary code on the target system

> "We've seen examples of these attacks in Hugging Face, where people uploaded malicious Pickle files that they claimed were machine learning models. Once a data scientist downloaded and loaded them with `pickle`, it could do arbitrary code execution."

**SAST Tool Output Example:**
```
[WARNING] pickle usage detected (CWE-502)
Severity: High
Confidence: 98%
CWE: 502 - Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Details: Using 'pickle' for deserialization from untrusted source may lead to arbitrary code execution.
```

*Instructor Emphasis*: "This vulnerability depends on the data you're loading. If it's your own trusted data, it might be safe—but if it's from a third party, it's dangerous."

## AI in Secure Code Analysis

### The Shift from Rule-Based to Learning-Based Approaches

> "AI is beginning to shape software development and software quality assurance."

**Traditional SAST:** Relies on predefined rules (e.g., pattern matching for `gets()`).

**AI-Powered Approach:** Uses machine learning trained on previous vulnerabilities to automatically learn patterns.

```
Previous known Vulnerabilities → Machine Learning → Prediction
```

### Why Use AI?

1. **More accurate detection**: Lower false positive rates than SAST tools.
2. **Scalability**: Trained models can scan codebases quickly once developed.
3. **No predefined rules needed**: Models learn patterns automatically.

*Instructor Insight*: "We did a study on the Linux project comparing traditional SAST tools with AI-based vulnerability prediction models."

**Performance Comparison (Linux Project):**
| Method | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| Traditional SAST Tools | Low performance in detecting vulnerabilities |
| AI-Based Prediction Models | Much better accuracy and lower false positive rates |

![AI vs SAST Performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01921.pdf)

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The AI model had much better performance, but it's still not perfect."

### Challenges of Using AI

#### 1. Trustworthiness Issues
> "AI models are not trustworthy. Outputs are not verifiable or interpretable."

Unlike SAST tools where you can see exactly why a warning was triggered (e.g., pattern matching), with AI you don't know *why* it flagged something.

#### 2. Computational Cost
- Training and running AI models is more computationally expensive than traditional SAST.
- Requires significant resources for development and deployment.

#### 3. Data Quality Problems ("The Elephant in the Room")
> "AI is a data-driven science. Garbage-in, garbage-out."

**Data Quality Issues:**
| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Known Unknowns** | Models miss vulnerabilities not previously detected (e.g., new vulnerability types) |
| **Inconsistency** | Different sources rank same vulnerability differently (up to 71% performance shift depending on data source) |

*Instructor Insight*: "We looked at Mozilla Firefox vulnerabilities across three different reporting systems: Bugzilla, Mozilla Security Advisory, and NVD. The severity rankings were inconsistent—vulnerability #6 was ranked low in two sources but high in the third."

**Severity Inconsistency Example (Mozilla Firefox):**

| Vulnerability ID | Bugzilla Ranking | Mozilla Ranking | NVD Ranking |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| **6** | **3** | **1** | **3** |

*Instructor Emphasis*: "Crashes or difficult-to-explain vulnerabilities are most inconsistent to assess."

### Large Language Models (LLMs) for Security

> "Large language models are less accurate than software vulnerability prediction models, but their generalizability makes them powerful tools."

**Performance Comparison:**
| Model | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|
| GPT-4 | 29% |
| Best Software Vulnerability Prediction Model | 94% |

*Instructor Insight*: "Despite lower accuracy, developers had positive sentiment toward using LLMs for security because of the natural language query interface."

**Real-World Impact:**
> "Up to 51% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities. The rise of AI-generated code reinforces the need for secure code review."

*Instructor Insight*: "This brings us full circle—when we use AI to generate code, it's up to us to do security program analysis to verify correctness because vulnerable code is being generated at scale."

### Current Industry Adoption

- **Microsoft Security Copilot**: Uses AI to enhance security workflows.
- **Snyk DeepCode AI**: Combines traditional SAST with AI for improved accuracy.
- **ChatGPT**: Used by developers as a general-purpose tool for security analysis (though not specifically designed for it).

*Instructor Insight*: "The most effective current approach is combining AI and static analysis. For example, Snyk uses AI to detect sinks and sources more accurately in taint analysis, while still using traditional methods for the rest of the process."

## Key Takeaways

### Program Analysis Summary
| Method | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Manual Code Review** | Context-aware, improves developer knowledge, flexible | Time-consuming, inconsistent quality |
| **SAST Tools** | Early integration, lightweight, good for simple rules | High false positives, limited coverage |
| **AI-Based Analysis** | Lower false positives (theoretically), scalable | Trust issues, computational cost, data dependency |

### Critical Insights from the Lecture

> "Every company is now a software company... Software skills are a valuable resource." - Satya Nadella

> "Software is eating the world." - Marc Andreessen

*Instructor Emphasis*: "The most important takeaway: These tools have limitations. You still need to verify warnings with your expertise—don't just trust the tool."

### Why This Matters for Your Projects
- **Peer Review**: When you review others' code, use OWASP Top 10 as a checklist.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Understand that SAST will flag many false positives—you must validate each finding.
- **AI Tools**: Be aware of AI's limitations when using tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for security analysis.

## Summary

Program analysis is essential for ensuring software security, with static analysis (both human-driven code review and automated SAST) forming the foundation. While traditional methods have high false positive rates and limited coverage, emerging AI approaches offer potential improvements in accuracy but face significant challenges related to data quality, trustworthiness, and computational cost.

The most effective current practice combines:
1. Human expertise with secure code reviews
2. Traditional SAST tools for early detection
3. AI as a complementary tool (not replacement) for specific tasks like sink/source identification

As software becomes increasingly embedded in all aspects of our lives ("software eating the world"), mastering these analysis techniques is critical for developing secure systems that protect user data and prevent catastrophic breaches.
