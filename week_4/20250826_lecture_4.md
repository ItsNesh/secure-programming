# Week 4: Lecture 4 - Memory Safety Vulnerabilities (Part II)

## Overview
This lecture continues our exploration of memory-related vulnerabilities, building on last week's discussion of buffer overflows. We'll examine integer-based vulnerabilities, format string exploits, off-by-one errors, and defensive strategies for writing secure code. The focus is on understanding how these vulnerabilities manifest in real-world systems and learning practical techniques to prevent them.

## Memory Fundamentals: Stack Operations

### Function Call Mechanics
When a function calls another function (e.g., `main()` calling `foo()`), the CPU follows a specific sequence using key registers:

1. **`ebp` (Base Pointer)** - Points to the start of the current stack frame
2. **`esp` (Stack Pointer)** - Points to the top of the current stack
3. **`eip` (Instruction Pointer)** - Points to the next instruction to execute

The function call process involves 11 critical steps:
1. Push arguments onto the stack
2. Push old `eip` (return address) onto the stack
3. Move `eip` to point to the called function's code
4. Push old `ebp` (stack frame pointer)
5. Move `ebp` to current position (`esp`)
6. Move `esp` to allocate space for local variables
7. Execute the function
8. Move `esp` back to deallocate local variables
9. Restore old `ebp`
10. Restore old `eip`
11. Remove arguments from stack

*Instructor Insight*: "The key idea is that before entering a function call, we need to store the return instruction pointer and the base pointer of the caller function so we can retrieve them when returning."

### Stack Memory Layout
- The **stack grows downward** (from higher addresses toward lower)
- Local variables are stored in the stack frame between `ebp` and `esp`
- Function calls create new stack frames that sit above previous ones

*Instructor Emphasis*: "This is why buffer overflows can be so dangerous—they allow attackers to overwrite critical return pointers."

---

## Integer Memory Safety Vulnerabilities

### Signed/Unsigned Comparison Issues
The classic vulnerability occurs when comparing signed and unsigned types:

```c
void func(int len, char *data) {
    char buf[64];
    if (len > 64)
        return;
    memcpy(buf, data, len);
}
```

**Problem**: `int` is signed but `size_t` is unsigned. If `len = -1`, it becomes a large positive value (`0xFFFFFFFF`) when cast to unsigned.

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why the comparison fails—negative values become huge numbers in unsigned types, causing buffer overflows."

**Safe version**:
```c
void safe(size_t len, char *data) {
    char buf[64];
    if (len > 64)
        return;
    memcpy(buf, data, len);
}
```

*Instructor Emphasis*: "Always use consistent types for comparisons. The safest approach is to make all size-related variables unsigned."

### Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities
Integer overflow occurs when adding values exceeds the maximum representable value:

```c
void func(size_t len, char *data) {
    char *buf = malloc(len + 2);
    if (!buf)
        return;
    memcpy(buf, data, len);
    buf[len] = '\n';
    buf[len + 1] = '\0';
}
```

**Problem**: If `len = 0xFFFFFFFF` (max unsigned int), then `len + 2 = 1`, causing a heap overflow.

*Instructor Insight*: "This is how the YouTube video count vulnerability happened in 2014—when views surpassed 2 billion, it wrapped around to negative values."

**Safe version**:
```c
void safe(size_t len, char *data) {
    if (len > SIZE_MAX - 2)
        return;
    char *buf = malloc(len + 2);
    if (!buf)
        return;
    memcpy(buf, data, len);
    buf[len] = '\n';
    buf[len + 1] = '\0';
}
```

*Instructor Emphasis*: "It's clunky but necessary to check bounds whenever you add integers."

### Real-World Impact
The **YouTube video count vulnerability** (2014) is a famous example:
- Video views reached `2^31 - 1` (max signed 32-bit integer)
- Overflowed to negative values, causing system errors
- Fix: Upgrade to 64-bit integers

*Instructor Insight*: "This shows how simple mistakes can have massive consequences—especially when dealing with high-profile systems."

---

## Format String Vulnerabilities

### How `printf` Works
`printf()` takes a format string and variable arguments:
```c
printf("One %s costs %d", fruit, price);
```

The format string tells `printf()` how many additional arguments to expect. If the number of format specifiers doesn't match actual arguments, it reads from memory.

*Instructor Insight*: "When you use a format specifier like `%d`, `printf` assumes there's another argument and looks 4 bytes up the stack for it."

### Vulnerable Code Example
```c
void vulnerable(void) {
    char buf[64];
    if (fgets(buf, 64, stdin) == NULL)
        return;
    printf(buf); // Problem: User controls format string!
}
```

**Why this is dangerous**: Attackers can supply a malicious format string to read or write arbitrary memory locations.

*Instructor Insight*: "This isn't about forgetting parameters—it's about trusting user input as the format string."

### Format Specifier Reference
| Specifier | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `%d`      | Signed integer |
| `%s`      | String pointer (dereferenced) |
| `%x`      | Hexadecimal value |
| `%%`      | Literal `%` character |
| `%n`      | Writes number of bytes printed to a memory address |

*Instructor Insight*: "The most dangerous specifier is `%n`, which allows attackers to write arbitrary values to specific memory locations."

### Exploiting with `%n`
Attackers can use `%n` to overwrite memory:
```c
// Target: Write 100 to address 0xdeadbeef
Input: "0xdeadbeef%94c%c%c%n"
```

**How it works**:
- `0xdeadbeef`: The target address (in little-endian format)
- `%94c`: Prints 94 characters (using up 4 bytes of the buffer)
- `%c%c`: Uses two more arguments
- `%n`: Writes number of bytes printed to the specified address

*Instructor Insight*: "The key is counting how many bytes are printed before reaching the `%n` specifier. We need exactly 100 bytes: `4 (address) + 94 (padding) + 1 + 1 = 100`."

### Defense Strategy
```c
void vulnerable(void) {
    char buf[64];
    if (fgets(buf, 64, stdin) == NULL)
        return;
    printf("%s", buf); // Always specify format type!
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "Never use untrusted input as the first argument to `printf`. This is a fundamental rule of secure coding."

---

## Off-by-One Vulnerabilities

### The Problem
Off-by-one errors occur when buffer sizes are miscalculated:

```c
void notSoSafeCopy(char *input) { 
    char buffer[512]; 
    int i; 
    for (i=0; i<=512; i++) // Off by one: should be < 512
        buffer[i] = input[i]; 
}
```

**Why it's dangerous**: This copies 513 bytes into a 512-byte buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

*Instructor Insight*: "This is particularly insidious because the overflow might not overwrite the return address (which would crash immediately), but could corrupt other critical data."

### Stack Frame Attack
Consider this vulnerable function:
```c
void vulnerable(void) {
    char name[20];
    fread(name, 21, 1, stdin); // Reads 21 bytes into 20-byte buffer
}
```

**Attack process**:
1. Overwrites the least significant byte of `SFP` (stack frame pointer)
2. Makes `SFP` point inside the vulnerable buffer (`name`)
3. When returning from function, program thinks `SFP` points to main's stack frame

*Instructor Insight*: "The key insight is that we're not overwriting the return address directly—we're manipulating the stack frame pointer so it points into our controlled buffer."

### Execution Flow
1. Attackers overwrite last byte of `SFP`
2. When returning from function, program moves `ESP` up and restores `EBP`
3. Program now thinks `EBP` points to a fake main's stack frame inside the buffer
4. When returning from main, it executes code at our specified address

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why off-by-one vulnerabilities are so dangerous—they allow attackers to redirect execution without directly overwriting return addresses."

## Writing Robust Exploits: NOP Sleds

### What Are NOP Sleds?
- **NOP** (No Operation) instructions do nothing but advance the instruction pointer
- A sequence of NOPs creates a "sled" that leads to shellcode
- Allows attackers to land anywhere in the sled and reach their payload

*Instructor Insight*: "Instead of needing exact memory addresses, you just need to be close enough. This makes exploits more reliable across different environments."

**Example**:
```
nop
nop
nop
...
xor %eax, %eax
push %eax
push $0x68732f2f
push $0x6e69622f
mov %esp, %ebx
... (shellcode)
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why modern exploits often use NOP sleds—they're a simple but effective way to handle memory layout variations."

## Defending Against Memory Safety Vulnerabilities

### Why Do These Vulnerabilities Persist?
1. **Human error**: Programmers make mistakes
2. **Legacy code**: Huge existing C/C++ codebases are hard to replace
3. **Performance myths**: "C is faster" (often not true for modern systems)
4. **Lack of security awareness**: Security isn't designed in from the start

*Instructor Insight*: "The real reason we still use memory-unsafe languages like C? Legacy code. If you have a million lines of existing code, it's cheaper to patch than rewrite."

### Defense Strategies

#### 1. Use Memory-Safe Languages
| Language | Safety Feature |
|----------|----------------|
| Java     | Automatic bounds checking |
| Python   | No pointer arithmetic |
| Rust     | Ownership model prevents buffer overflows |
| C#       | Bounds-checked arrays |

*Instructor Insight*: "Memory-safe languages are designed to prevent these vulnerabilities by design. Using them is the only way to stop 100% of memory safety issues."

#### 2. Write Memory-Safe Code
- **Use safe functions**:
  ```c
  // Instead of gets()
  fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
  
  // Instead of strcpy()
  strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest));
  
  // Instead of sprintf()
  snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), "value: %d", value);
  ```
- **Always validate inputs** (assume attackers know everything)
- **Use `sizeof()` for buffer sizes**:
  ```c
  fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin); // Safer than hardcoding size
  ```

*Instructor Insight*: "The key is to always specify the maximum number of bytes you'll read. This prevents overflows by design."

#### 3. Use Security Tools
- **Static analysis**: Automatically find vulnerabilities in code
- **Fuzz testing**: Random inputs to trigger crashes
- **Code reviews**: Human inspection for security flaws
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Check systems against known weaknesses

*Instructor Insight*: "The best approach is combining automated tools with human expertise. Tools can catch 80% of issues, but humans find the rest."

#### 4. Implement Runtime Checks
- Bounds checking (may have performance overhead)
- Crash on invalid operations
- Monitor for illegal calling sequences
- Run components in sandboxes

*Instructor Insight*: "Modern operating systems implement many of these mitigations automatically—ASLR randomizes memory addresses, stack canaries detect overflows."

---

## Real-World Security Considerations

### Legacy Code Challenges
- **iPhone example**: Apple's iOS still uses Objective-C (a C-based language) due to legacy codebases
- **Performance myth debunked**: Modern safe languages like Rust and Go have comparable performance to C
- **Time savings**: Writing in a memory-safe language saves more time than the tiny performance gain

*Instructor Insight*: "You don't need to choose between security and performance—you can have both. The 'performance' argument for using unsafe code is largely outdated."

### Third-Party Library Risks
- Vulnerabilities often come from third-party components
- Always check if libraries are up-to-date (use NVD/CVE databases)
- Patching may require restarts or break functionality

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why the OWASP Top 10 lists 'using vulnerable third-party components' as a major threat. You're inheriting all vulnerabilities from those libraries."

## Summary: Memory Safety Vulnerabilities

### Key Vulnerability Types
| Type | Description | How It Happens |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Buffer Overflow | Overwriting memory beyond buffer bounds | Unchecked input size (e.g., `gets()`) |
| Integer Overflow | Arithmetic overflow causing unexpected values | Adding large numbers (`len + 2` with max value) |
| Format String | Using user-controlled format string in `printf` | `printf(user_input)` instead of `printf("%s", user_input)` |
| Off-by-One | Buffer size calculation error (one byte off) | Loop condition mistake or buffer allocation |

### Defense Principles
1. **Never trust user input** - Validate all inputs as if they're malicious
2. **Use safe functions** - Prefer bounds-checked alternatives to unsafe ones
3. **Specify sizes explicitly** - Always use `sizeof()` for buffer sizing
4. **Consider memory-safe languages** where possible

*Instructor Insight*: "The most important principle is to assume attackers know everything about your system except the secret key—this mindset changes how you write code."
