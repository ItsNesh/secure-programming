I need to create concise, focused study notes from the textbook chapter about Access Control. I'll follow these guidelines:

1. Extract core concepts (5-10 most important)
2. Condense explanations into clear summaries
3. Define key terms simply
4. Include only essential examples
5. Focus on actionable knowledge for exams

Let me identify the 5-10 most important concepts from this chapter about Access Control:

1. **Access control levels** (hardware, OS, middleware, application)
2. **Discretionary vs Mandatory access control (DAC vs MAC)**
3. **ACLs and Capabilities** as two main approaches to managing access
4. **Operating system security models** (Unix, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)
5. **Sandboxing and Virtualization** for isolation
6. **Hardware protection mechanisms** (rings of protection, SGX, TrustZone)
7. **Common attack vectors** (stack smashing, ROP attacks, side channels)
8. **Security principles** like least privilege and secure defaults

Now I'll condense these into concise study notes following the formatting requirements.

Let me create a structured outline for my condensed notes:

- Title: Week 2 Study Notes - Access Control
- Core Concepts section (5-10 bullet points with brief explanations)
- Key Terms definitions
- Important examples summarized
- Summary box of key takeaways

I'll make sure to keep it concise, focused on what students need for exams and understanding.

Let me now create the actual study notes in markdown format.

# Week 2: Access Control - Study Notes

## Core Concepts

### 🔑 **Access Control Levels**
Systems implement access control at multiple layers:
- **Hardware**: Memory protection (rings, segmentation)
- **OS**: File permissions, process isolation
- **Middleware**: Database security, browser same-origin policy
- **Application**: Business rules (e.g., bank transactions requiring supervisor approval)

> *Higher levels are more expressive but also more vulnerable to attack*

### ⚖️ **DAC vs MAC**
| Type | Control Authority | Example Use Case |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** | User/administrator sets permissions | Standard Unix/Windows file permissions |
| **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** | Central policy authority (e.g., government) | Military systems, DRM for content protection |

> *Modern OSes blend both: Windows uses DAC with MAC features like integrity levels*

### 📋 **ACLs vs Capabilities**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
  - Store permissions by resource ("who can access this file?")
  - Common in Unix/Linux/Windows
  - Hard to revoke access when users change

- **Capabilities**:
  - Store permissions by user ("what resources can I access?")
  - More efficient for runtime checks, easier delegation
  - Used in modern systems (e.g., iOS app permissions)

> *ACLs: "File X allows Alice read/write" | Capabilities: "Alice has capability to read file X"*

### 🛡️ **Security Principles**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users/processes should have only necessary access
- **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations must be secure (not dangerous)
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple approvals

> *Failure here leads to security holes: e.g., "suid root" programs with excessive privileges*

### 🌐 **Modern Security Mechanisms**
| Technology | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Sandboxing** | Restrict app behavior (e.g., browser tabs) | Java/JavaScript sandboxed execution |
| **Virtualization** | Isolate processes on single machine | VMs for development vs production environments |
| **Enclaves** | Secure memory regions in CPU | Intel SGX, Arm TrustZone |

> *Side-channel attacks like Spectre/Meltdown undermine these mechanisms*

## Key Terms

- **Principals**: Entities that request access (users, processes, machines)
- **Protection Domain**: Set of resources accessible to a process/thread
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browser security rule preventing cross-site script execution
- **TOCTTOU** ("Time-of-check-to-time-of-use"): Race condition vulnerability

## Common Attack Vectors

### 💥 **Memory Safety Exploits**
| Type | Description | Modern Example |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Stack Smashing | Overwriting memory buffer to execute malicious code | Morris worm (1988) |
| Use-After-Free | Using freed memory as if still allocated | Browser vulnerabilities in recent years |
| ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) | Building attacks from existing code snippets | Bypasses DEP/ASLR |

> *Mitigations: Stack canaries, ASLR, Data Execution Prevention*

### 🕵️ **User Interface Failures**
- **"Admin by Default"**: Windows required admin privileges for software installation
  - Led to millions of users with unnecessary elevated access
  - Resulted in widespread malware infections

## Summary Box: Key Takeaways

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Access control is layered (hardware → OS → app) | Each layer has different security properties and vulnerabilities |
| DAC vs MAC represents fundamental design choice | Modern systems blend both approaches for flexibility/security balance |
| Least privilege + secure defaults = critical defense | Most breaches occur due to excessive permissions or insecure configurations |
| Hardware protections have limits | Side-channel attacks (Spectre/Meltdown) undermine even enclave mechanisms |

> *Remember: Security is not just technical—it's about how systems are designed, configured, and used in real-world environments*
