Okay, the user wants me to create concise study notes from a textbook chapter about input sanitizing and authorization. They've provided detailed instructions on how they want these notes formatted - very specific requirements for brevity, focus on exam-relevant content, and scannable formatting.

Looking at this Week 2 material, I need to extract the absolute core concepts while cutting all fluff. The chapter covers input sanitizing, authorization flaws (like session management), OS command injection, deserialization issues, authentication bypass techniques, and data leakage prevention. 

Hmm... the key challenge here is distilling Anderson's book references into actionable points without getting bogged down in textbook details. For exam purposes, students need to know: what vulnerabilities look like (XSS/SQLi examples), how they happen (bad input handling), and concrete fixes (sanitization vs validation).

I notice the learning outcomes emphasize practical application - so I'll focus on "how to fix" not just "what is". The readings mention Ross Anderson's chapters but students don't need book summaries, just the security principles extracted from them.

*Brainstorming core concepts:*
1. Input sanitizing (vs validation) as primary defense
2. Session management flaws (token fixation etc.)
3. OS command injection examples 
4. Deserialization risks with untrusted data
5. Auth bypass techniques (like weak password policies)
6. Data leakage prevention methods

*Eliminating redundancies:*
- The "web is distributed computing" intro? Skip.
- All the "we assume you know XSS/SQLi" - just state they're examples of input flaws.
- Anderson chapter details can be reduced to "Study 27.4-5 for vulnerability prioritization".

For formatting, I'll use:
- Bolded key terms (like **Input Sanitizing**)
- Bullet points only for critical items
- One table comparing sanitization vs validation methods
- No paragraphs longer than two lines

*Checking length:* Original text is ~600 words. Target 200-250 words max. Need to cut all examples except one killer example (like `'; DROP TABLE users;` for SQLi).

Ah, and must include the "why it matters" - like how session fixation leads to account takeover. But keep that sentence tight: "Session fixation → attacker hijacks user's active session."

*Final check against requirements:*
- 7 core concepts? (within 5-10 range)
- All learning outcomes covered via application points
- No fluff from textbook intro
- Only essential terms defined simply ("Deserialization = converting data back to objects")

...Time to distill this into surgical precision. The user's clearly prepping for exams - they'll want to memorize these bullet points while cramming.

### Week 2: Input Sanitizing & Authorization  
*Focus: Core vulnerabilities, fixes, and exam-critical concepts*

---

#### **Core Concepts**  
1. **Input Sanitizing vs. Validation**  
   - *Sanitizing*: Clean input (e.g., remove `'` from strings) → **prevents injection attacks**.  
   - *Validation*: Check if input matches expected format (e.g., email regex) → **blocks invalid data early**.  
   > ⚠️ Never rely solely on sanitization; use validation + parameterized queries for SQL.

2. **Critical Flaws & Examples**  
   | Vulnerability       | Example Attack                     | Fix                          |
   |---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
   | **OS Command Injection** | `user_input = " ; rm -rf /"` → deletes files | Use safe APIs (e.g., `subprocess.run()`, not `os.system()`) |
   | **Session Management Flaw** | Session fixation: Attacker sets victim’s session ID via URL | Regenerate tokens after login; use secure cookies (`HttpOnly, Secure`) |
   | **Deserialization Risk** | Untrusted data → arbitrary code execution (e.g., Java `ObjectInputStream`) | Avoid deserializing untrusted input; validate schemas |

3. **Authentication Bypass Tactics**  
   - Weak password policies (e.g., "password123").  
   - Hardcoded credentials in config files.  
   > ✅ *Fix*: Enforce strong passwords, use salted hashing (`bcrypt`), never store plaintext.

4. **Data Leakage Prevention**  
   - **Sensitive data exposure**: Leaking tokens/SSNs via error messages or logs.  
     → *Fix*: Mask errors (e.g., "Invalid login" not "User doesn’t exist"), audit log access.

#### **Key Terms Simplified**  
- **Authorization**: *"Can this user do X?"* (e.g., admin vs. guest permissions).  
- **Authentication**: *"Are you who you claim to be?"* (e.g., password/login).  
- **CVE System**: *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures* → Standardized IDs for known flaws (e.g., CVE-2023-1234).

---

#### **Exam Focus: What You Must Apply**  
> 💡 **Testable Scenarios**:  
> - Given a code snippet with `user_input` in SQL query → **identify injection risk** and rewrite using parameterized queries.  
> - Spot session fixation via URL parameters (e.g., `?session_id=abc123`) → **fix by regenerating tokens post-login**.  
> - Recognize deserialization in logs/requests → **block untrusted data sources**.

#### **Summary Box: Vulnerability Prioritization (Anderson 27.4)**  
| Priority | Example                | Action                          |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **High** | SQLi, Auth bypass      | Patch immediately; input validation mandatory |
| **Medium** | Session fixation       | Regenerate tokens + secure cookies |
| **Low**   | Minor error messages   | Mask errors (no technical details) |

> ✅ *Remember*: Secure coding = **Validate all inputs**, **never trust user data**, and **minimize sensitive data exposure**.
