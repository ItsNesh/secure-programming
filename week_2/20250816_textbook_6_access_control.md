# Comprehensive Study Notes: Chapter 6 - Access Control

## Introduction to Access Control

### Core Concept
Access control is **the central pillar of computer security**, functioning to regulate which principals (persons, processes, machines) have access to which resources in a system. It controls:
- Which files users can read
- Which programs they can execute
- How data is shared between principals

> "Anything your computer can do for you it can potentially do for someone else." - A.L. Ox  
> "Security systems have an nasty habit of backfiring and there's no doubt they would cause enormous problems." - Rick Maybury

### Historical Context
Access control became the center of gravity in security from the 1970s onward, as computers evolved beyond single-user mainframes to multi-process environments. Early computing had physical security only (punched cards), but with time-sharing systems came the need for **protection mechanisms** preventing one program from interfering with another.

### Access Control Levels
Access control operates at multiple levels in a system:

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Hardware | Processor and memory management controls | Memory protection, segmentation |
| Operating System | Controls access to files, ports, resources | File permissions on Linux/Windows |
| Middleware | Enforces security between applications | Web browsers, database systems |
| Application | Domain-specific policies for specific tasks | Bank call center restrictions |

> "As we work up from the hardware through the operating system and middleware to the application layer, the controls become progressively more complex and less reliable."

## Operating System Access Controls

### Core Mechanisms
#### 1. Access Control Matrix Model
A fundamental model representing access permissions as a matrix:

- **Columns**: Resources (files)
- **Rows**: Principals (users)

Permissions are represented by:
- `r` = read permission
- `w` = write permission
- `x` = execute permission
- `-` = no access

**Example Matrix (Figure 6.1):**
```
Operating Accounts Accounting Audit
System Program Data Trail
Sam       rwx   rwx    rw     -
Alice      x     x     rw     -
Bob        rx    r      r     r
```

*Interpretation:*
- Sam has full access to all resources except the audit trail (which he can only read)
- Alice needs to execute programs but not tamper with them; she must use approved interfaces
- Bob, as an auditor, can read everything

**Limitations:** 
This model doesn't scale well for large systems. A bank with 50,000 staff and 300 applications would require a matrix of **15 million entries**, creating performance overheads and administrative complexity.

#### 2. Access Control Matrix Variants
Two main approaches to managing the access control matrix:

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Column-based (ACL) | Store permissions per resource ("column") | Natural for user-managed security; common in Unix systems | Inefficient at runtime; hard to find all files a user can access |
| Row-based (Capabilities) | Store permissions per principal ("row") | Efficient for runtime checks; easy delegation | Hard to change file status; difficult to track who has access |

**Example of Capability (Figure 6.4):**
```
User      Operating System Program Accounts Data Audit Trail
Bob       rx          r        r     r
```

*Interpretation:* Bob's capabilities show he can read all resources.

### Groups and Roles

#### Key Concepts:
- **Group**: A list of principals (users)
- **Role**: A fixed set of access permissions that one or more principals may assume for a period of time

**Classic Role Example:** "Officer of the watch on a ship" - exactly one person holds this role at any given time with formal procedures for handover.

#### Implementation Challenges:
1. **Group vs Role Distinction**: 
   - *Groups* express organizational rank (e.g., manager)
   - *Roles* include specific permissions in context (e.g., "acting manager of Cambridge branch")

2. **Real-World Example**:
   > In banking: The manager of the Cambridge branch might have privileges expressed by membership of group `manager` and assumption of role `acting_manager_Cambridge_branch`. 
   > *Policy*: "Transfers over $10m must be approved by two staff, one with rank at least manager and one with rank at least assistant accountant."

3. **Security Implications**:
   - If the branch manager is sick, an assistant accountant acting as manager might need a second signature from regional head office.

### ACLs (Access Control Lists)

#### Implementation in Unix
Traditional Unix systems use `rwx` attributes for owner/group/world:

- First character: `-` = file, `d` = directory
- Next three characters (`rwx`): Owner permissions
- Middle three characters (`rwx`): Group permissions
- Last three characters (`rwx`): World (others) permissions

**Example ACL:**  
`drwxrwxrwx Alice Accounts` - Directory with all permissions for owner, group, and world.

**Real Example from Text:**
```
-rw-r----- Alice Accounts
```

*Interpretation:* 
- File type = regular file (`-`)
- Owner (Alice) can read/write (`rw`)
- Group members (Accounts) can only read (`r`)
- World has no access (`-`)

#### Limitations of Unix ACLs:
1. **Root Privilege Issue**: Root user (`uid=0`) bypasses all security checks
   - *Problem*: System administrator could modify audit trails, making it hard to defend against false accusations or cover up intrusions.
   - *Solution*: Traditional approach was sending logs to a printer in locked room; modern solution is separate logging server.

2. **SUID (Set-User-ID) Mechanism**:
   - Allows programs to run with owner's privileges rather than invoking user's
   - Example: Create `account-package` user owning file 2, mark as SUID, place in directory accessible by Alice
   
3. **Security Problems with SUID**:
   > "Programmers are often lazy or facing tight deadlines; so they just make the application suid root, so it can do anything."
   
   This practice leads to security holes because responsibility for access control moves from OS environment to applications.

4. **State Management Issues**: 
   - ACLs don't handle mutable state well (e.g., transactions requiring manager + accountant approval)
   - Hard to revoke access when employees are fired

5. **Single-User Limitation**:
   - Unix ACL only names one user
   - *Solution*: Older systems used groups; newer systems implement POSIX extended ACLs with multiple named users/groups.

### DAC (Discretionary Access Control) vs MAC (Mandatory Access Control)

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- **Definition**: Security policy is controlled by the owner of resources or system administrator
- **Model**: "You start your computer in supervisor mode and then, as the administrator, you can make less-privileged accounts available"
- **Example**: Traditional Unix systems where root user has complete control

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- **Definition**: Security policy is enforced by a central authority regardless of owner's actions
- **Origin**: Military research program in 1970s to protect classified information ("Top Secret" files can't be accessed by "Secret" clearance users)
- **Key Difference**: In MAC, the sysadmin isn't the boss; ultimate control rests with remote government authority setting security policy

#### Evolution of MAC:
| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1970s | US military research for multilevel secure (MLS) systems |
| 1980s | Safety engineers develop safety integrity levels, similar to MLS concepts |
| 1990s | Creative industries lobby for DRM as form of MAC ("preventing sharing with non-subscribers") |
| Early 2000s | Microsoft and Intel incorporate MAC into products via Trusted Computing Group |

#### Modern Implementations:
- **Windows Vista (2006)**: Introduced trusted boot using TPM chips to prevent persistent malware
- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: Smartcard chip on motherboard supporting trusted boot, hard disk encryption

> "The real supervisor on the system is no longer you, the machine owner â€“ it's the operating-system vendor."

### OS-Specific Implementations of Access Control

#### 1. Unix Security Model
- **Root User**: Has unrestricted access; can do anything (access any file, become any user)
- **Security Issues**:
  - Difficulty implementing audit trails that root cannot modify
  - SUID programs often misused as `suid root` for convenience rather than necessity

#### 2. macOS Security Model
- Based on FreeBSD Unix with Mach kernel
- Default: Root account disabled; administrators in "wheel" group (can `su` to root)
- **Mandatory Access Control**: Since version 10.5 (Leopard), uses TrustedBSD variant for MAC protection of core system components

#### 3. iOS Security Model
- Based on Unix with Mach kernel and FreeBSD modifications
- **Key Features**:
  - Apps have *permissions* as capabilities (request access to services like camera, SMS)
  - Trust-on-first-use model: User consents when app first requests service
  - Closed ecosystem: iPhone only runs apps signed by Apple

> "The security of mobile devices is a rather complex issue involving not just access controls and tamper resistance but the whole ecosystem."

**Security Architecture Details (iOS):**
- **Secure Enclave**: Dedicated processor for sensitive operations (fingerprint, payments)
- **Key Management**: Unique 256-bit AES key burned into fusible links on system-on-chip
- **Passcode Handling**: Ten tries to enter passcode; keys derived from master key only after successful entry

#### 4. Android Security Model
- Based on Linux with apps running under different user IDs
- **Key Features**:
  - Apps have *permissions* as capabilities (request access to device services)
  - Signed packages (.apk files) using self-signed certificates as developer names
  - Permissions must be approved by users for "dangerous" permissions

> "Android is the world's most widely used operating system, with 2.5 billion active Android devices in May 2019."

**Evolution of Permission Model:**
- **Early Versions**: Required all permissions on installation or app wouldn't run
- **Problem**: Users clicked through everything (e.g., flashlight apps demanded address book access)
- **Android 6+**: Moved to Apple-style trust-on-first-use model

> "Since Android 5, SELinux has been used to harden the OS with MAC."

#### 5. Windows Security Model
**Evolution:**
1. **Early Versions (Pre-Windows NT)**: No access control - all software ran as root
2. **Windows NT**: First version with proper security model; inspired by Unix but extended:
   - Additional attributes beyond read/write/execute (`takeownership`, `changepermissions`, `delete`)
   - Multiple values for permissions (`AccessDenied`, `AccessAllowed`, `SystemAudit`)

3. **Active Directory** (Core of Windows Security):
   - Hierarchical namespace organizing users, groups, machines
   - Manages remote authentication via Kerberos or TLS

4. **Key Features in Modern Windows:**
   - **User Account Control (UAC)**: Replaced default admin privilege with user defaults; requires elevation prompts for privileged tasks
   - **Dynamic Access Control**: Controls access by context (work PC vs home PC, phone)
   - **Principals & Security Identifiers (SIDs)**: Represent users/computers/processes in security contexts

> "Windows evolved to provide a richer and more flexible set of access control tools than any system previously sold in mass markets."

**Why Windows is Complex:** 
Driven by corporate customers needing to manage tens of thousands of staff across hundreds of sites with internal controls limiting damage from dishonest staff or infected machines.

## Middleware Access Controls

### Database Security
Database security mechanisms are often more complex than OS-level controls:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Access Control Model** | Mix of ACLs and capabilities (privileges for both users and objects) |
| **Stateful Policies** | Prevent user from learning too much about customers; deal with statistical inference rather than simple yes/no rules |
| **Common Failure Mode** | Developers bypassing OS controls by using database accounts instead of operating system accounts |

> "In many installations, the database is accessible directly from outside; even where shielded by web service front-end, loopholes often let SQL code be inserted."

**Real-World Example:**
- **Slammer Worm (2003)**: Propagated via stack-overflow exploit against Microsoft SQL Server 2000
- Created massive traffic as compromised machines sent attack packets to random IP addresses

### Browser Security
Browsers are critical middleware platforms for access control:

**Core Protection Mechanism:** 
- **Same-Origin Policy**: JavaScript/active content can only communicate with the original domain it came from (enforced via sandboxing)

> "The browser is the place on your laptop where you run code written by people you don't want to trust and who will occasionally be malicious."

#### Common Browser Security Failures:
1. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: 
   - Malicious website includes links/form buttons that execute actions when user clicks
   - Example URL: `https://mybank.com/transfer.cgi?amount=10000USD&recipient=thief`
   - *Countermeasures*: Short-lived sessions, anti-CSRF tokens (invisible MAC of session cookie), checking Referer header

2. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfigurations**:
   - Example: Amazon Alexa had misconfigured CORS policy allowing subdomain compromise to replace skills with malicious ones
   - *Result*: Anyone compromising another Amazon subdomain could replace target Alexa skills

## Sandboxing and Virtualization

### Sandboxing
- **Definition**: Restricted environment where code has no access to local hard disk (or limited temporary access) and can only communicate with host it came from.
- **Origin**: Introduced by Sun with Java programming language in late 1990s.

**How It Works:**
- Code executed by interpreter (Java Virtual Machine - JVM)
- Limited memory access rights
- Enforced via same-origin policy

> "This is enforced by having the code executed by an interpreter â€“ the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) â€“ with only limited access rights."

### Virtualization
**Definition**: Technology enabling a single machine to emulate multiple independent machines.

#### Evolution:
1. **Early 1960s**: IBM VM/370 partitioned mainframes into virtual machines for legacy app support.
2. **2003**: VMware ESX Server and Xen enabled cloud computing revolution by handling resource usage well.
3. **Modern Cloud Computing**: Powers data centers where users rent VMs for $10-$50/month.

**Security Implications:**
- **Hypervisor Security Claim**: VMM code can be smaller than OS, making it easier to review/secure
- **Reality Check**: "Whether there are actually fewer vulnerabilities is of course an empirical question."

#### Client-Side Virtualization:
- Allows running guest OS on host (e.g., Windows on macOS)
- Enables security separation: e.g., employee has two copies of Windows - one locked-down for office, another for home

**Real Example:** 
- **Samsung Knox**: Creates VM on mobile phone that employer can lock down and manage remotely while user enjoys normal Android.

#### Containerization (2010s):
- **Definition**: Lightweight alternative to virtualization; isolated guest process sharing kernel with other containers
- **Key Difference from VMs**:
  - VM: Complete OS insulated by hypervisor
  - Containers: Isolated processes sharing a kernel

> "Containers have been the hot new topic in late 2010s... they evolved as lightweight alternative to virtualization."

#### Security Issues with Containers:
- **Real Example (2019)**: Biometric identification service left entire database unprotected; researchers found millions of people's photos, fingerprints, passwords on unsecured Elasticsearch.
- **Hardware Limitations**: Meltdown and Spectre side-channel attacks undermine container/VM security.

## Hardware Protection

### Memory Management & Segmentation
**Classic Mechanism:** Segment addressing - memory addressed by two registers:
1. Segment register pointing to segment of memory
2. Address register pointing within that segment

> "The implementation has become more complex as processors themselves have."

#### Historical Processor Evolution:
- **IBM Mainframes**: Early systems had 2-state CPU (authorized vs non-authorized)
- **Multics (MIT, 1960s)**: Introduced rings of protection with varying privilege levels
  - Ring 0: Complete access to disk/supervisor state
  - Ring 2: Supervisor processes
  - User code at less privileged levels

### Intel Processors & Security Features

#### Key Developments:
| Year | Feature | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1982 | Explicit parameter checking instructions (verify read/write/length) | Prevent stack overflows, but avoided by developers to prevent architecture dependencies |
| 2006 | Hardware support for virtualization (Intel VT-x) | Enable cloud computing; run unmodified OSes faster and more robustly |
| 2015 | Software Guard Extensions (SGX) | Create encrypted memory enclaves for trusted code execution |

**SGX Details:**
- **Memory Encryption Engine**: Encrypts enclave data
- **New Instructions & Memory Checks**: Prevent non-enclave processes from accessing enclave memory
- **Security Perimeter**: CPU itself; software is encrypted in main memory (costing time/space)
- **Current Vulnerabilities**: 
  - Return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks within enclaves
  - "Stealthy return-oriented programming" attacks on host apps

> "SGX has been promoted for DRM and securing cloud VMs, particularly those containing crypto keys or sensitive personal information; this is under threat from Spectre and similar attacks."

### Arm Processors & Security Features

#### Key Developments:
- **Arm Architecture**: Most common processor in phones/tablets/IoT devices
- **TrustZone (2004)**: "Two worlds" model for security
  - Open world: Normal OS/applications
  - Closed enclave: For sensitive operations (cryptography, critical I/O)
  
> "Phones were the 'killer app' for enclaves as operators wanted to lock subsidised phones and regulators wanted baseband software tamper-resistant."

**TrustZone Features:**
- Secure mode orthogonal to user/supervisor modes
- Hosts single trusted execution environment (TEE) with separate stacks, simplified OS
- Runs only signed code by OEM

> "Arm's latest offering is CHERI which adds fine-grained capability support to Arm CPUs... could prevent most zero-day exploits of recent years."

## What Goes Wrong: Security Vulnerabilities & Attacks

### Attack Types and Evolution

#### 1. Memory Overwriting (Stack Smashing)
- **Classic Exploit**: Morris worm in 1988
- **Mechanism**:
  - Program accepts input without size checking
  - Long argument overwrites stack, executing attacker's code
  - Landing pad: NOP instructions to catch processor execution

> "Attacks involving violations of memory safety accounted for well over half the exploits against operating systems in late 1990s and early 2000s."

**Example (Figure 6.5):**
```
Malicious argument â†’ Overlong input buffer â†’ Landing pad (NOP) â†’ Malicious code
```

#### 2. Other Technical Attacks

| Attack Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Use After Free** | Memory freed but still used, leading to malicious function invocation | Common in browser exploits; most common remote execution vulnerability today |
| **SQL Injection** | User input not sanitized before passing to database | Careless web developer passes user input containing SQL code directly to backend DB |
| **Race Conditions (TOCTTOU)** | Transaction carried out in stages with access rights verified at first stage, sensitive action done later; attacker alters state between steps | Early Unix `mkdir` vulnerability: Replace directory with link to password file during two-step process |

#### 3. Advanced Attack Techniques
- **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**:
  - Uses existing code ("gadgets") ending in return instructions
  - Assembles Turing-complete machine from these gadgets
  - Defeats Data Execution Prevention by using legitimate code

> "Many modern systems try to prevent type safety attacks... but an attacker can look for gadgets..."

- **Block-Oriented Programming (BOP)**:
  - Generates ROP chains automatically from crashes discovered via program fuzzing
  - Defeats current control-flow integrity controls

#### 4. Side Channel Attacks (2018)
| Attack | Target Processor | Mechanism |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Meltdown** | Intel processors | Exploits out-of-order execution; leaks memory via cache timing differences |
| **Spectre** | Intel, AMD, Arm | Exploits speculative execution (predicting future instructions) |

> "The basic idea is that large modern CPUs' pipelines are so long and complex they look ahead... The path not taken can still load information into a cache..."

#### 5. User Interface Failures
- **Classic Example**: Windows confirmation dialogues trained users to click boxes away, combined with requiring administrator privileges for software installation.
  
> "Until 2006 a user needed to be the administrator to install anything... hundreds of millions had admin privileges they shouldn't have."

**Resulting Impact:**
- Malware ecosystem established in PC world
- Android ecosystem now developing similar issues as businesses pressure people to install apps rather than use websites

### Remedies for Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Technical Defenses:
| Defense | Year Introduced | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Stack Canaries** | ~2003 | Random number inserted next to return address on stack; if overwritten, canary changes |
| **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** | 2003 (Windows XP) | Marks memory as data or code; prevents execution of data segments |
| **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** | ~2003 | Makes memory layout different in each system instance to prevent target address prediction |
| **Control Flow Integrity** | 2005 | Analyzes possible control-flow graph at compile time, enforces it at runtime |

#### 2. Better Tools:
- **Static Analysis Programs**: (e.g., Coverity) find potential software bugs early
- **Secure Programming Languages**: Rust replacing C/C++ for systems code

> "Rust emerged from Mozilla research in 2010 and has been used to redevelop Firefox; it's been voted the favorite language in Stack Overflow annual survey from 2016â€“2019."

#### 3. Better Training:
- Microsoft security initiative (2002): All programmers trained in secure coding
- Book: "Writing Secure Code" still worth reading

#### 4. DevSecOps Approach:
- Agile development methodology extended to rapid patch deployment and incident response
- Focuses effort on most urgent problems through continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines

### Environmental Creep (Security Model Failure)

**Definition**: Security mechanisms that worked in initial environment fail when environmental changes occur.

**Unix Case Study:**
1. **Original Design**: "Single user Multics" - security for containing mistakes
2. **Evolution to Networked Systems**: 
   - Berkeley versions assumed extension from single machine to network of machines on one LAN under one management
   - Internet mechanisms (telnet, ftp) originally written for mainframes on secure networks with no transfer of authorization

> "The arrival of billions of phones... has left security engineers running ever faster to catch up."

**Key Environmental Changes:**
- From single machine â†’ networked systems â†’ internet
- From trusted users in lab setting â†’ millions of untrusted apps from selfish/malicious authors
- From simple bugs â†’ malicious code

## Summary and Key Takeaways

### Core Principles of Access Control
1. **Layering**: Security operates at multiple levels (hardware, OS, middleware, application)
2. **Trade-offs**: Higher-level mechanisms are more expressive but often less reliable
3. **Evolution**: Systems evolve beyond original security assumptions ("environmental creep")
4. **Complexity vs Usability**: More complex systems tend to have more vulnerabilities

### Security Model Evolution Timeline:
| Era | System Type | Primary Security Approach |
|-----|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1960s-70s | Mainframes, early time-sharing | Physical security; basic access control for contained environments |
| 1980s | Workstations, LANs | DAC (Discretionary Access Control) - owner-controlled permissions |
| Late 1980s-Early 2000s | Networked systems, Internet | MAC (Mandatory Access Control) research; early DRM attempts |
| Mid-2000s-Present | Mobile devices, cloud computing | Hybrid models with strong hardware security features |

### Key Security Failures by System Type:
1. **Unix**: SUID root programs bypassing proper access control
2. **Windows**: Default admin privileges for all users; poor user interface design leading to malware installation
3. **Mobile (iOS/Android)**: Overly permissive app permissions, lack of sandboxing in early implementations

### Modern Security Challenges:
- **Hardware Limitations**: Side-channel attacks undermining enclaves and containers
- **Ecosystem Complexity**: Mobile ecosystems require security beyond just access control mechanisms
- **Usability Issues**: Poor usability leads to insecure defaults (e.g., "allow all" permissions)
