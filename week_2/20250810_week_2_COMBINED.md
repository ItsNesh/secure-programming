# Week 2: Lecture 2 - Designing for Security & Threat Modeling

<think>
I'll create comprehensive lecture notes for a student who missed class on Week 2, Lecture 2 of "Secure Programming" based on the provided slides and transcript. I need to synthesize everything into natural, flowing educational notes that would allow a student to learn all necessary information from these notes alone.

Let me plan out how to structure this:

1. Start with clear title including week/lecture info
2. Add an Overview section immediately after title
3. Organize content using hierarchical headers (# ## ###)
4. Include Key Insights from Transcript in the specified format
5. Synthesize information rather than just listing slides
6. Use proper formatting for important terms, examples, etc.
7. End with a Summary/Key Takeaways

Let me go through each section of the lecture and synthesize it:

**Week 2: Lecture 2 - Designing for Security & Threat Modeling**

First, I'll create an engaging title that captures the essence of the lecture.

Then I'll write an overview summarizing what was covered in this lecture.

Now let's break down the content by topic:

1. **Course Logistics and Assessment Information** (Slides 3-5)
2. **Threat Modeling Fundamentals** (Slides 6-18, transcript discussion)
   - Threat modeling process
   - STRIDE methodology
   - Data Flow Diagrams
   - Attack Trees
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework
3. **Security Principles and OWASP Top 10** (Slides 24-37, transcript discussion)
   - Kerckhoff's Principle
   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
4. **Input Sanitization & Authentication Vulnerabilities** (Slides 38-73, transcript discussion)
   - Injection attacks
   - SQL injection example
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

I'll make sure to synthesize the information from both slides and transcript, rephrasing for clarity while preserving all important concepts.

Let me now create these notes in markdown format following all the requirements.
</think>


### Overview  
This lecture covers foundational security concepts including threat modeling methodologies, key cybersecurity principles, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and practical examples of input sanitization failures. We'll explore how to identify threats early in the development lifecycle through structured approaches like STRIDE methodology and data flow diagrams, while also examining common vulnerability patterns that lead to security breaches.

---

### Threat Modeling Fundamentals  

#### What Is a Threat?  
A *threat* is an event that could negatively impact systems, data, or operations. The goal of threat modeling is to identify these threats **early**—before any code is written—to prevent costly fixes later.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Security isn't just about writing secure code—it starts in the requirements phase. If you don't address security early, fixing it later can cost up to 100x more."

#### CIA Triad: Core Security Principles  
| Principle | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Confidentiality** | Data is accessible only to authorized users | Passwords not exposed in logs |
| **Integrity** | Data remains unaltered by unauthorized parties | Preventing tampering with financial records |
| **Availability** | Systems are operational when needed | DDoS protection for critical services |

#### Threat Modeling Process  
1. Identify assets (what needs protection)  
2. Map data flows using *Data Flow Diagrams* (DFDs)  
3. Apply threat modeling frameworks to identify vulnerabilities  
4. Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood  

---

### STRIDE Methodology: A Practical Framework  

STRIDE is a mnemonic framework developed by Microsoft for identifying threats in software design:

| STRIDE Element | Security Property | Description |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Spoofing** | Authentication | Identity verification (e.g., login systems) |
| **Tampering** | Integrity | Unauthorized data modification (e.g., changing order amounts) |
| **Repudiation** | Nonrepudiation | Inability to deny actions (e.g., digital signatures) |
| **Information Disclosure** | Confidentiality | Unintended data exposure (e.g., password leaks) |
| **Denial of Service** | Availability | System unavailability (e.g., DDoS attacks) |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Authorization | Unauthorized access to higher privileges |

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Authentication verifies *who* you are; authorization determines *what you can do*. A system with perfect authentication but poor authorization is still vulnerable."

#### Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Basics  
DFDs visually represent how data moves through a system. Key rules:
- Entities (users, systems) must connect to processes via directional arrows
- Processes require at least one input and output
- Use domain-specific names for clarity

**DFD Construction Steps**:  
1. **Context Diagram (Level 0)**: Identify all external entities and the main system process  
2. **System Breakdown (Level 1+)**: Decompose complex processes into sub-processes  
3. **Data Stores**: Identify databases or storage systems  

> **Example from Transcript**  
> > "For a library system, external entities include users and librarians. The main system is the website. Breaking it down reveals login processing as a key sub-process."

---

### Attack Trees: Thinking Like an Attacker  

Attack trees model threats from the *attacker's perspective* using decision tree structures:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Root Node** | Primary attack goal (e.g., "Steal user data") |
| **Intermediate Nodes** | Steps to achieve the root goal |
| **Leaf Nodes** | Specific actions or capabilities required |

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Attack trees help estimate attacker capability requirements. For example, cutting open a safe requires tools and strength—costing more than stealing written combination."

#### MITRE ATT&CK Framework  
A globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques:

- **Tactics**: High-level attack goals (e.g., Initial Access, Execution)  
- **Techniques**: Specific methods to achieve tactics (e.g., Phishing for initial access)  

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "MITRE ATT&CK is invaluable for threat modeling. It captures real-world attacks so you can proactively defend against them."

---

### Kerckhoff's Principle: The Foundation of Secure Design  

> **"A cryptosystem should remain secure even if the attacker knows all internal details except the secret key."**  
> — *Kerckhoff's Principle*

This principle rejects "security through obscurity"—never assume attackers don't know your system design. Instead, focus on protecting only what must be kept secret: **the key**.

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Hardcoded secrets in code (like passwords) are a major vulnerability. Always use secure key management systems."

---

### OWASP Top 10: Critical Web Vulnerabilities  

The OWASP Top 10 lists the most critical web application security risks (2021 update):

| # | Risk Category | Key Insight |
|---|---------------|-------------|
| **A01** | Broken Access Control | *Failure to enforce permissions* → Users access admin features they shouldn't. |
| **A02** | Cryptographic Failures | *Unencrypted data in transit/at rest* → Passwords stored as plaintext. |
| **A03** | Injection | *User input not validated* → SQLi, command injection (e.g., `'; DROP TABLE users;--`). |
| **A04** | Insecure Design | *Flaws in architecture* → Cost 100x more to fix later than during design. |
| **A05** | Security Misconfiguration | *Default settings or unnecessary features enabled* → Exposed admin panels. |
| **A06** | Vulnerable Components | *Outdated libraries* → Major cause of breaches (e.g., Log4j vulnerability). |
| **A07** | Identification & Authentication Failures | *Weak passwords, no MFA* → Credential stuffing attacks. |
| **A08** | Software/Data Integrity Failures | *Unverified updates* → Malicious software in supply chain. |
| **A09** | Security Logging/Monitoring Failures | *No logs for breaches* → Inability to detect incidents quickly. |
| **A10** | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | *Attacker forces server to access internal systems* → Data exfiltration. |

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Insecure design is the costliest flaw—fix it early or pay 100x later. Threat modeling helps catch these during requirements."

---

### Input Sanitization & Authentication Vulnerabilities  

#### Injection Attacks: The Core Problem  
*Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (e.g., SQL, OS commands).*

##### Example: Command Injection
```php
$t = $_REQUEST['ip'];
$o = shell_exec('ping -C 3 ' . $t); // Vulnerable!
echo $o;
```

**Attack**:  
`127.0.0.1; ls` → Executes `ping -C 3 127.0.0.1; ls`  
→ **Result**: Lists directory contents (unauthorized access)

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Always validate and sanitize user input. Never trust it—assume attackers will try to break your system."

##### SQL Injection: A Classic Case
```php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$getid = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = $id";
```

**Attack**: `1 OR 1=1;--` → Returns all rows from the database

| Attack | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `1' OR '1'='1` | Bypasses authentication |
| `1'; DROP TABLE users;--` | Deletes entire user table |

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Prepared statements (separating data from queries) prevent SQLi. Never concatenate user input directly into queries."

---

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

##### Types of XSS:
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Reflected (Non-Persistent)** | Malicious script reflected in URL → executed immediately | `http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>` |
| **Stored (Persistent)** | Malicious script stored on server → executes for all users viewing content | Forum comment with embedded `<script>...</script>` |

**Impact**: Steal cookies, redirect to phishing sites, deface websites.

---

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  

##### How It Works:
1. User logs into bank.com  
2. Attacker tricks user into clicking malicious link:  
   `http://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&dest=attacker`  
3. Browser sends session cookie → server processes transfer

**Key Difference from XSS**:  
- CSRF requires *user interaction* (clicking a link)  
- Requires *active session* with target site  

> **Key Insight from Transcript**  
> > "CSRF is like tricking someone into signing a document they didn't read. The bank assumes you're acting intentionally."

---

### Summary & Key Takeaways  

#### Core Principles to Remember
1. **Threat modeling starts early**: Identify threats *before* coding (use STRIDE/DFDs)  
2. **Never trust user input**: Sanitize all inputs; use prepared statements for SQL  
3. **Authentication ≠ Authorization**: Verify identity *and* permissions  
4. **Kerckhoff's Principle**: Assume attackers know your system—protect only the key  
5. **OWASP Top 10 is essential**: Focus on A01 (access control), A03 (injection), and A06 (vulnerable components)  

#### Critical Actions for Students
- Start RangeForce *immediately* (7-day access window)
- Review OWASP Top 10 categories before next lecture
- Practice threat modeling using STRIDE on a simple app (e.g., library system)
- **Never** test systems without permission—use sandboxes

> **Final Insight from Transcript**  
> > "Security isn't about perfect code—it's about making it *harder* for attackers than the value they'd gain. Focus on defense-in-depth: multiple layers of security, not just one."

# Week 2: Secure Systems Development (Ch. 27.4 & 27.5) - Study Notes

<think>
I need to create concise study notes from textbook chapters 27.4 and 27.5 based on the provided content.

Let me identify the key concepts I should focus on:

From Chapter 27.4 (Prioritizing protection goals):
1. Risk vs reward tradeoffs in security decisions
2. The importance of context in security analysis
3. Business model examples showing how security can be seen as an opportunity rather than a cost
4. Safety vs security valuation differences

From Chapter 27.5 (Methodology):
1. Software engineering approaches: waterfall vs iterative/agile
2. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
3. Gated development for security patches
4. DevSecOps and the shift to continuous integration/deployment with security considerations
5. Vulnerability lifecycle management
6. Organizational risk management challenges

Let me now extract the most important points from each section, focusing on what students would need to know for exams.

For Chapter 27.4 (Prioritizing protection goals):
- The key is balancing risk and reward - security should be seen as an opportunity rather than just a cost
- Business example: Fraud management team reporting to sales vs finance leads to different outcomes
- Safety valuation varies significantly across contexts ($50k for road junctions vs $500m for train systems)
- "Don't trust people who can only talk about 'tightening security' - often it's already too tight"

For Chapter 27.5 (Methodology):
1. Software engineering approaches:
   - Waterfall model: linear, sequential process
   - Iterative/Agile approach: solve worst problem first and repeat

2. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) components:
   - Requirements with risk assessment & quality gates
   - Design with threat modeling
   - Implementation using approved tools
   - Verification through dynamic analysis/fuzz testing
   - Release with incident response plan

3. Gated development: Security patches go through additional tests before release, like Microsoft's "Patch Tuesday"

4. DevSecOps:
   - Integrating security into the entire software lifecycle
   - Shift left (integrate security early)
   - Continuous monitoring and automated testing

5. Vulnerability cycle management:
   - Responsible disclosure vs coordinated disclosure
   - CVE system for tracking vulnerabilities
   - Incident response plan components: monitoring, repair, distribution, reassurance

6. Organizational challenges in risk management:
   - "Bezos' law" about team size (can't have more people than can be fed from two pizzas)
   - Risk of checklists replacing critical thinking ("perversely worse later")
   - CISO role challenges: short tenure, difficult position

Now I'll create concise study notes following the formatting requirements.

I need to:
- Keep it 30-40% of original length
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for scanning
- Bold key terms/concepts
- Include only essential examples summarized briefly
- Make it perfect for exam preparation

Let me structure this as a markdown document with clear sections.
</think>


### 🔑 Core Concepts in Prioritizing Protection Goals

#### 💡 Key Principles
- **Risk vs Reward Balance**: Security decisions must align with business goals, not just security metrics  
  *Example*: Fraud team reporting to sales (focus on revenue opportunity) > finance (viewed as cost)
  
- **Context Matters**: Safety/security valuation varies dramatically by context:
  | Context                | Valuation per Life Saved |
  |------------------------|--------------------------|
  | Road junctions         | ~$50,000                 |
  | Train protection       | >$500 million            |
  | Flu jabs               | Few hundred dollars      |

- **Don't "Tighten Security" Blindly**: Often security is already too tight; focus on *targeting* it correctly

#### 💡 Business Insight
> *"Profit is the reward for risk. Entrepreneurs who succeed may have to improve security quickly."*
> - Example: Zoom's rapid growth (20M → 200M users) forced major security engineering effort

### 🛠️ Secure Systems Development Methodology

#### ⚙️ Software Engineering Approaches
| Approach       | Key Features                                  | Best For                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Waterfall**  | Linear, sequential; requirements → deployment | Known requirements (e.g., crypto processors) |
| **Agile/Iterative** | Solve worst problem first; repeat           | Changing environments, UI design |

- *Key Insight*: "Just as each generation of a biological species must be viable for the species to continue, so each software version must work"

#### 🔐 Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
*Microsoft's 2010 simplified implementation:*
1. **Requirements**: Risk assessment + quality gates ("bug bars")
2. **Design**: Threat modeling + attack surface definition
3. **Implementation**: Approved tools + static analysis
4. **Verification**: Dynamic testing/fuzzing
5. **Release**: Incident response plan

> *Note*: "Security needs a subject-matter expert (SME) from outside dev team"

#### 🔄 Vulnerability Management Cycle
1. Researcher discovers vulnerability → 
2. Discloses to vendor or sells on market → 
3. Vendor issues patch → 
4. Customers apply patches

**Critical Insight**:  
> *"The threat of disclosure was needed to get vendors to patch."* (Responsible Disclosure)

#### ⚙️ DevSecOps Evolution
- **Shift Left**: Integrate security early in development process
- **Gated Development**: Security checks at regular intervals before release ("Patch Tuesday")
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Frequent small updates with automated testing

> *Example*: Google's "Site Reliability Engineering" (SRE) approach:
> - Set realistic error budget (e.g., 0.1% downtime)
> - Use residual time for experiments and resilience testing
> - Design for recoverability, understandability, minimize human intervention

---

### ⚠️ Organizational Risk Management Challenges

#### 🧩 Key Issues
- **Bezos' Law**: "Can't run a dev project with more people than can be fed from two pizzas" (Team size limit ~8)
  
- **Checklist Trap**: 
  > *"Certified processes had strong tendency to displace critical thought... hiding uncertainty and making it worse later."*

- **CISO Challenges**:
  - Short tenure (~2 years average)
  - "Thankless job": Saying no constantly, requires people skills
  - CEO/board must prioritize security for success

#### 💡 Critical Insight on Risk Culture
> *"Getting the risk ecosystem right in an organization can take both subtlety and persistence."*

### 📌 Exam-Focused Summary: Must-Know Concepts

| Concept                  | Key Point                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Risk vs Reward**       | Security should be seen as opportunity (e.g., fraud management → sales)   |
| **SDL Components**       | Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Release                |
| **Vulnerability Cycle**  | Responsible disclosure > coordinated disclosure for complex supply chains  |

| **Error Budgets**        | Realistic downtime allowance (e.g., 0.1%) to enable innovation           |

> 💡 *Remember*: Security is not about eliminating all risks, but prioritizing protection goals based on business context and risk-reward tradeoffs.

---

### 📚 Key Terms
- **CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - standardized vulnerability numbering system (Mitre maintains)
- **SDL**: Secure Development Lifecycle - process for integrating security throughout development
- **DevSecOps**: Integrating security into DevOps practices ("shift left")
- **Error Budget**: Time allocated to failures before service degradation becomes unacceptable

# 🔒 Cryptography Essentials: Core Concepts & Exam Focus

<think>
Let me analyze this request. The user has provided a lengthy textbook excerpt about cryptography from "Security Engineering" by Ross Anderson (Chapter 5), and wants me to create concise study notes based on specific instructions.

The key requirements are:
1. Extract core concepts (5-10 most important)
2. Condense explanations
3. Define key terms simply
4. Include only essential examples
5. Focus on actionable knowledge for exams

I need to condense this 60-page chapter into a much shorter study guide that's perfect for exam preparation.

Let me identify the core concepts from Chapter 5:

1. **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography**: The fundamental distinction between these two types of cryptographic systems.
2. **Block Ciphers and Modes of Operation**: How block ciphers work, especially AES, and why mode choice matters (ECB is dangerous).
3. **Hash Functions**: Their properties and applications like HMAC.
4. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Certificates, certification authorities, and their challenges.
5. **RSA Cryptosystem**: The most common public key system based on factoring.
6. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: How it enables secure key establishment over insecure channels.
7. **Digital Signatures**: Including DSA and ECDSA variants.
8. **TLS Protocol**: Its evolution, security issues, and importance in web security.
9. **Side Channel Attacks**: A major practical threat to implementations (timing, power analysis).
10. **Quantum Computing Threats**: How quantum computers could break current public key systems.

Now I'll create a concise study guide focusing on these core concepts with the required formatting:

- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Bold key terms/concepts
- Keep paragraphs short
- Include only essential information for exam preparation

I need to be careful not to include too much detail - this should be 30-40% of the original length.

Let me structure my response as requested, focusing on what would help a student prepare for an exam in cryptography.
</think>


### 🧠 Fundamental Concepts (5 Key Principles)

1. **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Crypto**
   - *Symmetric*: Same key for encryption/decryption (AES, DES)
   - *Asymmetric*: Public/private key pairs (RSA, ECC) based on hard math problems
   - **Key Insight**: Symmetric is faster; asymmetric solves the "key distribution problem"

2. **Block Cipher Modes of Operation**
   | Mode       | Security Level | Danger |
   |------------|----------------|--------|
   | ECB        | ❌ Very Weak    | Always avoid (patterns visible) |
   | CBC        | ✅ Good         | Requires IV, vulnerable to padding oracle attacks |
   | GCM        | ✅ Best         | Authenticated encryption |

3. **Hash Functions & HMAC**
   - *Purpose*: Create fixed-size fingerprints of data
   - *Properties*: Preimage resistance, collision resistance
   - **HMAC**: `h(k⊕B, h(k⊕A, M))` where A=0x36, B=0x5C (prevents length extension attacks)

4. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   CA[Certification Authority] -->|Signs| Cert1[(Certificate)]
   Cert1 --> User[User's Public Key]
   ```
   - *Challenge*: Trust management, certificate revocation

5. **TLS Protocol Evolution**
   | Version | Year  | Security Improvements |
   |---------|-------|------------------------|
   | SSL 3.0 | 1996  | Basic encryption        |
   | TLS 1.2 | 2008  | SHA-256, AEAD support   |
   | **TLS 1.3** | **2019** | **Mandatory forward secrecy**, removed weak ciphers |

### 🔐 Critical Algorithms & Systems

#### RSA Cryptosystem
- *Math Basis*: Factoring large primes (p×q)
- *Encryption*: `C = M^e mod N`
- *Decryption*: `M = C^d mod N` where `de ≡ 1 mod φ(N)`
- **Security Note**: Must use OAEP padding to prevent attacks

#### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
```plaintext
Alice: g^a → Bob
Bob:   g^b → Alice
Shared key: (g^a)^b = (g^b)^a = g^(ab)
```
- **Forward Secrecy**: Session keys change per session, protecting past traffic

#### Digital Signatures (DSA/ECDSA)
- *Process*: `Sig_d(M) = M^d mod N` then verify with public key
- **Key Difference**:
  - DSA: Based on discrete logs in prime fields
  - ECDSA: More efficient using elliptic curves

### ⚠️ Common Implementation Failures (Exam Focus)

| Failure Type          | Example                          | Consequence               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Weak Random Numbers** | Predictable keys                 | Entire system compromised |
| **Side Channels**       | Timing attacks on decryption     | Private key extracted     |
| **Bad Mode Choice**     | ECB mode for images              | Patterns visible in ciphertext |
| **Export Controls**     | 40-bit weak crypto (1990s)       | Easy to break             |

### 💡 Essential Exam Knowledge

#### Why TLS 1.3 is Important
- Mandatory Diffie-Hellman key exchange at session start → **forward secrecy**
- Removed all legacy ciphers and insecure protocols
- Banks can no longer intercept encrypted sessions for monitoring (major industry impact)

#### Quantum Computing Threats
| System Type       | Current Security Level | Post-Quantum Risk |

> 💡 *Exam Tip*: "Don't roll your own crypto" is the most important principle - all major security failures come from custom implementations.

### 📚 Key Terms Simplified

* **Semantic Security**: An attacker can learn nothing about plaintext from ciphertext
* **Forward Secrecy**: Compromising one session key doesn't break past sessions
* **Backward Security**: Compromising current keys won't reveal past traffic (achieved via hashing)
* **Nonce**: Random number used once per transaction to prevent replay attacks

### ✅ Summary Box: What Students Must Know for Exams

1. **Never use ECB mode** - it's fundamentally insecure
2. TLS 1.3 requires forward secrecy using Diffie-Hellman at session start
3. RSA needs proper padding (OAEP) or is vulnerable to multiple attacks
4. Side channel attacks are the most common real-world crypto failures today
5. Asymmetric systems require keys **twice as long** as symmetric for equivalent security

# Week 2: Access Control - Study Notes

<think>
I need to create concise, focused study notes from the textbook chapter about Access Control. I'll follow these guidelines:

1. Extract core concepts (5-10 most important)
2. Condense explanations into clear summaries
3. Define key terms simply
4. Include only essential examples
5. Focus on actionable knowledge for exams

Let me identify the 5-10 most important concepts from this chapter about Access Control:

1. **Access control levels** (hardware, OS, middleware, application)
2. **Discretionary vs Mandatory access control (DAC vs MAC)**
3. **ACLs and Capabilities** as two main approaches to managing access
4. **Operating system security models** (Unix, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)
5. **Sandboxing and Virtualization** for isolation
6. **Hardware protection mechanisms** (rings of protection, SGX, TrustZone)
7. **Common attack vectors** (stack smashing, ROP attacks, side channels)
8. **Security principles** like least privilege and secure defaults

Now I'll condense these into concise study notes following the formatting requirements.

Let me create a structured outline for my condensed notes:

- Title: Week 2 Study Notes - Access Control
- Core Concepts section (5-10 bullet points with brief explanations)
- Key Terms definitions
- Important examples summarized
- Summary box of key takeaways

I'll make sure to keep it concise, focused on what students need for exams and understanding.

Let me now create the actual study notes in markdown format.
</think>


### Core Concepts

#### 🔑 **Access Control Levels**
Systems implement access control at multiple layers:
- **Hardware**: Memory protection (rings, segmentation)
- **OS**: File permissions, process isolation
- **Middleware**: Database security, browser same-origin policy
- **Application**: Business rules (e.g., bank transactions requiring supervisor approval)

> *Higher levels are more expressive but also more vulnerable to attack*

#### ⚖️ **DAC vs MAC**
| Type | Control Authority | Example Use Case |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** | User/administrator sets permissions | Standard Unix/Windows file permissions |
| **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** | Central policy authority (e.g., government) | Military systems, DRM for content protection |

> *Modern OSes blend both: Windows uses DAC with MAC features like integrity levels*

#### 📋 **ACLs vs Capabilities**
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
  - Store permissions by resource ("who can access this file?")
  - Common in Unix/Linux/Windows
  - Hard to revoke access when users change

- **Capabilities**:
  - Store permissions by user ("what resources can I access?")
  - More efficient for runtime checks, easier delegation
  - Used in modern systems (e.g., iOS app permissions)

> *ACLs: "File X allows Alice read/write" | Capabilities: "Alice has capability to read file X"*

#### 🛡️ **Security Principles**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users/processes should have only necessary access
- **Secure Defaults**: Default configurations must be secure (not dangerous)
- **Separation of Duties**: Critical operations require multiple approvals

> *Failure here leads to security holes: e.g., "suid root" programs with excessive privileges*

#### 🌐 **Modern Security Mechanisms**
| Technology | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Sandboxing** | Restrict app behavior (e.g., browser tabs) | Java/JavaScript sandboxed execution |
| **Virtualization** | Isolate processes on single machine | VMs for development vs production environments |
| **Enclaves** | Secure memory regions in CPU | Intel SGX, Arm TrustZone |

> *Side-channel attacks like Spectre/Meltdown undermine these mechanisms*

### Key Terms

- **Principals**: Entities that request access (users, processes, machines)
- **Protection Domain**: Set of resources accessible to a process/thread
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browser security rule preventing cross-site script execution
- **TOCTTOU** ("Time-of-check-to-time-of-use"): Race condition vulnerability

### Common Attack Vectors

#### 💥 **Memory Safety Exploits**
| Type | Description | Modern Example |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Stack Smashing | Overwriting memory buffer to execute malicious code | Morris worm (1988) |
| Use-After-Free | Using freed memory as if still allocated | Browser vulnerabilities in recent years |
| ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) | Building attacks from existing code snippets | Bypasses DEP/ASLR |

> *Mitigations: Stack canaries, ASLR, Data Execution Prevention*

#### 🕵️ **User Interface Failures**
- **"Admin by Default"**: Windows required admin privileges for software installation
  - Led to millions of users with unnecessary elevated access
  - Resulted in widespread malware infections

### Summary Box: Key Takeaways

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Access control is layered (hardware → OS → app) | Each layer has different security properties and vulnerabilities |
| DAC vs MAC represents fundamental design choice | Modern systems blend both approaches for flexibility/security balance |
| Least privilege + secure defaults = critical defense | Most breaches occur due to excessive permissions or insecure configurations |
| Hardware protections have limits | Side-channel attacks (Spectre/Meltdown) undermine even enclave mechanisms |

> *Remember: Security is not just technical—it's about how systems are designed, configured, and used in real-world environments*

# Secure Programming: Protocol Basics - Tutorial Notes

<think>
Okay, the user wants me to create concise study notes from a textbook chapter about secure programming tutorials. They've provided specific slides with content about protocols and communication basics.

Looking at Slide 1 through Slide 8, I need to extract only the most essential information for exam preparation. The key topics seem to be: application layer protocol definitions (Slide 2), HTTP methods (Slide 3), a demo protocol implementation (Slide 4), design considerations (Slide 5), existing protocols (Slide 6), and VM setup basics (Slide 7).

I should focus on the core concepts that would appear in exams. The HTTP method descriptions are crucial - I'll condense those into a clean table since they're standard exam material. For Slide 4's demo, I can summarize it as an example of protocol implementation without showing all code.

The design considerations (Slide 5) and discussion points (Slide 8) contain important conceptual questions students might be tested on regarding protocol design trade-offs. I'll distill those into bullet points about security awareness and key decision areas.

For Slide 6's existing protocols, I'll list the most relevant ones for secure communication without going into all examples. The VM setup instructions (Slide 7) are procedural but not exam-critical - I can mention it briefly as a prerequisite step.

I need to be ruthless in cutting redundancy: no need to repeat "what is an application layer protocol" when we have clear definitions, and the Python code snippets aren't necessary for conceptual understanding. The summary should fit in 30-40% of original length - I'll aim for about 15 bullet points total.

The formatting must be scannable: bolded key terms like **Application Layer Protocol**, short paragraphs max two sentences, tables where helpful (like the HTTP methods table). No fluff - every line should serve study purpose.

For security emphasis (Slide 6), I'll make sure to highlight "Always consider Security at every step!" as a standalone principle since it's repeated. The VM setup is just context for labs so I'll mention it minimally under prerequisites.
</think>


### Core Concepts  
**Application Layer Protocol**: Rules defining communication between two parties (e.g., data structure, signal interpretation). *Examples*: HTTP, ICMP (Ping).  

#### Key HTTP Methods (Condensed)  
| Method | Purpose                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| `GET`  | Request resource data            |
| `POST` | Submit new data                  |
| `PUT`  | Replace entire resource          |
| `DELETE`| Remove specified resource        |
| `HEAD` | Get headers only (like `GET`)    |

> 💡 *Exam Tip*: Know the **primary purpose** of each method.  
> *(e.g., `POST` = new data submission; `PUT` = full replacement)*  

---

### Protocol Design Essentials  
#### Critical Questions to Address  
1. **Authentication**: Do users need login? How are identities managed?  
2. **Message Structure**: Fields (timestamp, sender), error handling for malformed messages.  
3. **Reliability**: ACKs required? Handling disconnections/race conditions.  
4. **Security**: *Always* integrate security at every design step (*Slide 6*).  

> ⚠️ **Non-negotiable Principle**: *"Consider Security at every step!"* (e.g., avoid plaintext passwords in messages).  

---

### Existing Secure Protocols to Leverage  
| Purpose          | Recommended Protocol       |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Messaging        | WebSockets over TCP, IRC   |
| File Transfer    | SFTP, SCP                  |

> 🔐 **Key Insight**: *Reuse secure protocols* (e.g., use SFTP instead of FTP) to avoid reinventing security.  

---

### Practical Setup & Focus Areas  
- **VM Requirement** (for labs): Ubuntu VM via VirtualBox/VMware (*Slide 7*).  
- **Exam Focus**: Protocol design trade-offs, not implementation details.  
  > *Example question*: *"Why would you choose WebSockets over IRC for real-time chat?"*  
  > ✅ *Answer: Lower latency + better security (TLS support in WebSockets)*  

---

### Summary Box: Protocol Design Checklist  
> **1. Structure**: Define message fields clearly (e.g., `{"sender": "Alice", "msg": "Hi"}`).  
> **2. Security**: Encrypt sensitive data; validate all inputs.  
> **3. Error Handling**: Return specific errors (`400 Bad Request`, not generic `"Error"`).  
> **4. Scalability**: Handle disconnections (e.g., reconnection logic for chat apps).  

> 💡 *Remember*: A protocol fails if it ignores security or edge cases (*Slide 8* questions are exam favorites!).

# 20250810 Week 2

<think>
Okay, the user wants me to create concise study notes from a textbook chapter about input sanitizing and authorization. They've provided detailed instructions on how they want these notes formatted - very specific requirements for brevity, focus on exam-relevant content, and scannable formatting.

Looking at this Week 2 material, I need to extract the absolute core concepts while cutting all fluff. The chapter covers input sanitizing, authorization flaws (like session management), OS command injection, deserialization issues, authentication bypass techniques, and data leakage prevention. 

Hmm... the key challenge here is distilling Anderson's book references into actionable points without getting bogged down in textbook details. For exam purposes, students need to know: what vulnerabilities look like (XSS/SQLi examples), how they happen (bad input handling), and concrete fixes (sanitization vs validation).

I notice the learning outcomes emphasize practical application - so I'll focus on "how to fix" not just "what is". The readings mention Ross Anderson's chapters but students don't need book summaries, just the security principles extracted from them.

*Brainstorming core concepts:*
1. Input sanitizing (vs validation) as primary defense
2. Session management flaws (token fixation etc.)
3. OS command injection examples 
4. Deserialization risks with untrusted data
5. Auth bypass techniques (like weak password policies)
6. Data leakage prevention methods

*Eliminating redundancies:*
- The "web is distributed computing" intro? Skip.
- All the "we assume you know XSS/SQLi" - just state they're examples of input flaws.
- Anderson chapter details can be reduced to "Study 27.4-5 for vulnerability prioritization".

For formatting, I'll use:
- Bolded key terms (like **Input Sanitizing**)
- Bullet points only for critical items
- One table comparing sanitization vs validation methods
- No paragraphs longer than two lines

*Checking length:* Original text is ~600 words. Target 200-250 words max. Need to cut all examples except one killer example (like `'; DROP TABLE users;` for SQLi).

Ah, and must include the "why it matters" - like how session fixation leads to account takeover. But keep that sentence tight: "Session fixation → attacker hijacks user's active session."

*Final check against requirements:*
- 7 core concepts? (within 5-10 range)
- All learning outcomes covered via application points
- No fluff from textbook intro
- Only essential terms defined simply ("Deserialization = converting data back to objects")

...Time to distill this into surgical precision. The user's clearly prepping for exams - they'll want to memorize these bullet points while cramming.
</think>

#### Week 2: Input Sanitizing & Authorization  
*Focus: Core vulnerabilities, fixes, and exam-critical concepts*

---

##### **Core Concepts**  
1. **Input Sanitizing vs. Validation**  
   - *Sanitizing*: Clean input (e.g., remove `'` from strings) → **prevents injection attacks**.  
   - *Validation*: Check if input matches expected format (e.g., email regex) → **blocks invalid data early**.  
   > ⚠️ Never rely solely on sanitization; use validation + parameterized queries for SQL.

2. **Critical Flaws & Examples**  
   | Vulnerability       | Example Attack                     | Fix                          |
   |---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
   | **OS Command Injection** | `user_input = " ; rm -rf /"` → deletes files | Use safe APIs (e.g., `subprocess.run()`, not `os.system()`) |
   | **Session Management Flaw** | Session fixation: Attacker sets victim’s session ID via URL | Regenerate tokens after login; use secure cookies (`HttpOnly, Secure`) |
   | **Deserialization Risk** | Untrusted data → arbitrary code execution (e.g., Java `ObjectInputStream`) | Avoid deserializing untrusted input; validate schemas |

3. **Authentication Bypass Tactics**  
   - Weak password policies (e.g., "password123").  
   - Hardcoded credentials in config files.  
   > ✅ *Fix*: Enforce strong passwords, use salted hashing (`bcrypt`), never store plaintext.

4. **Data Leakage Prevention**  
   - **Sensitive data exposure**: Leaking tokens/SSNs via error messages or logs.  
     → *Fix*: Mask errors (e.g., "Invalid login" not "User doesn’t exist"), audit log access.

---

##### **Key Terms Simplified**  
- **Authorization**: *"Can this user do X?"* (e.g., admin vs. guest permissions).  
- **Authentication**: *"Are you who you claim to be?"* (e.g., password/login).  
- **CVE System**: *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures* → Standardized IDs for known flaws (e.g., CVE-2023-1234).

---

##### **Exam Focus: What You Must Apply**  
> 💡 **Testable Scenarios**:  
> - Given a code snippet with `user_input` in SQL query → **identify injection risk** and rewrite using parameterized queries.  
> - Spot session fixation via URL parameters (e.g., `?session_id=abc123`) → **fix by regenerating tokens post-login**.  
> - Recognize deserialization in logs/requests → **block untrusted data sources**.

---

##### **Summary Box: Vulnerability Prioritization (Anderson 27.4)**  
| Priority | Example                | Action                          |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **High** | SQLi, Auth bypass      | Patch immediately; input validation mandatory |
| **Medium** | Session fixation       | Regenerate tokens + secure cookies |
| **Low**   | Minor error messages   | Mask errors (no technical details) |

> ✅ *Remember*: Secure coding = **Validate all inputs**, **never trust user data**, and **minimize sensitive data exposure**.  
> *(Source: Anderson Ch. 27, Ross; Focus on implementation fixes over theory)*
