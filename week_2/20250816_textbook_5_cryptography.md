# Comprehensive Cryptography Study Guide

## 1. Symmetric Cryptography Fundamentals

### 1.1 Block Ciphers
Block ciphers are cryptographic algorithms that operate on fixed-size blocks of data (typically 64 or 128 bits) using a secret key.

**Key Concepts:**
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - The current standard for symmetric encryption, replacing DES.
- **Substitution and Permutation Networks** - AES is constructed through careful combination of substitutions (S-boxes) and permutations to achieve confusion and diffusion properties.
- **Modes of Operation** - How block ciphers are used in practice:
  * ECB (Electronic Codebook): Encrypts each block independently. **Insecure for most applications due to pattern preservation**
  * CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext before encryption, creating dependency between blocks.
  * CTR (Counter Mode): Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting successive counter values.

> "Never use ECB mode unless you really understand what you're doing."

### 1.2 Stream Ciphers
Stream ciphers generate a keystream that is combined with the plaintext to produce ciphertext, typically using XOR operations.

**Construction from Block Ciphers:**
- Can be constructed by putting block ciphers in specific modes of operation (like CTR mode)
- Have different error propagation properties compared to block cipher modes

### 1.3 Hash Functions
Hash functions take an input message and return a fixed-size output called a hash digest.

**Key Properties:**
- **One-way**: Given h = H(x), it should be computationally infeasible to find x.
- **Collision-resistant**: It should be hard to find two different inputs that produce the same hash (x ≠ y but H(x) = H(y)).
- **Preimage resistance**: Hard to reverse a given hash value back to its input.

**Common Hash Functions:**
| Algorithm | Output Size | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| MD5       | 128 bits    | Broken for collision attacks (no longer secure) |
| SHA-1     | 160 bits    | Vulnerable, no longer recommended |
| SHA-2     | Various sizes (SHA-256, SHA-384, etc.) | Current standard |
| SHA-3/Keccak | Various sizes | NIST-standardized alternative to SHA-2 |

**Example of Hash Collision:**
> In February 2017, scientists from Amsterdam and Google published a collision for SHA-1 (the first practical attack), proving the point that it was insecure. This led to widespread migration away from SHA-1.

### 1.4 HMAC - Keyed Hashing
HMAC is an algorithm for message authentication using hash functions with keys:
```
HMAC_k(M) = h(k ⊕ B, h(k ⊕ A, M))
```
Where:
- `A` and `B` are constants (0x36 and 0x5C repeated)
- `h` is the underlying hash function
- `k` is the secret key

**Purpose:** Provides message authentication using a shared secret key.

> "If a hash function is on the weak side, this construction can make exploitable collisions harder to find."

### 1.5 Merkle Trees for Large Data Structures
Merkle trees are used to efficiently verify large data structures by hashing multiple inputs into a single root hash:
```
Root = H(H(left_child) || H(right_child))
```
**Structure:**
- Leaves contain hashes of individual data blocks
- Each non-leaf node contains the hash of its child nodes' hashes

**Applications:**
1. **Code Signing**: Allows verification without waiting for all files to be checked.
2. **Blockchain Applications**: A blockchain is essentially a Merkle tree.

> "Merkle saw that you could generate a series of private keys by encrypting a counter with a master secret key, and then use a tree to hash the resulting public keys."

## 2. Asymmetric Cryptography

### 2.1 RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- **Euler's Theorem**: For integer n with gcd(a,n)=1, a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n
- φ(n) = number of positive integers less than n that are coprime to n

For RSA:
- N = p × q (product of two large primes)
- φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
- Public exponent e: gcd(e, φ(N)) = 1
- Private key d: de ≡ 1 mod φ(N)

**Encryption & Decryption:**
```
C ≡ M^e mod N   [Encryption]
M ≡ C^d mod N    [Decryption]
```
> "Neither RSA encryption nor signature is safe to use on its own. The reason is that, as encryption is an algebraic process, it preserves certain algebraic properties."

### 2.2 OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)
OAEP adds randomness and redundancy to prevent attacks:
```
C1 = M ⊕ h(N)
C2 = N ⊕ h(C1)
Result: C = RSA_encrypt(C1 || C2)
```
**Purpose:** Prevents chosen-ciphertext attacks, low-exponent attacks, and homomorphism-based attacks.

> "This was eventually proven to be secure. There are a number of public-key cryptography standards; PKCS #1 describes OAEP."

### 2.3 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
A protocol for establishing shared secrets over an insecure channel:
```
Alice: Choose random x_A, compute y_A = g^x_A mod p
Bob:   Choose random x_B, compute y_B = g^x_B mod p

Shared secret:
  Alice computes K = (g^x_B)^x_A mod p = g^(x_A*x_B) mod p
  Bob computes K = (g^x_A)^x_B mod p = g^(x_A*x_B) mod p
```
**Forward Security:**
- If transient keys are used, an attacker who compromises past private keys cannot decrypt future communications.
- "Even if an opponent had inspected both their machines before this protocol was started... the opponent could still not eavesdrop on their traffic."

### 2.4 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
A variant of ElGamal signatures that uses discrete logarithms:

**Key Parameters:**
- Prime p (typically 2048 bits for security level equivalent to RSA-2048)
- Prime q (256 bits, dividing p-1)
- Generator g of order q modulo p
- Private signing key x
- Public verification key y = g^x mod p

**Signature Process:**
```
r ≡ (g^k mod p) mod q   [Random k]
s ≡ (h(M) - xr)/k mod q  [Hash h(M)]
Sig_x(M) = (r, s)
```
### 2.5 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Uses discrete logarithms on elliptic curves
- An elliptic curve is defined by y² = x³ + ax + b

**Advantages over Traditional Systems:**
1. **Performance**: Requires less computation and shorter keys for equivalent security.
2. **Efficiency in constrained environments**: Used in EMV payment cards, Bitcoin.

> "Elliptic curve cryptography uses discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve – a curve given by an equation like y² = x³ + ax + b."

**Security Comparison:**
| Security Level | RSA Key Size (bits) | ECC Key Size (bits) |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 80 bits        | ~1024              | ~160                |
| 112 bits       | ~2048              | ~224                |
| 128 bits       | ~3072              | ~256                |

> "Elliptic curve systems appear to achieve this bound; a 256-bit elliptic scheme could be about as hard to break as a 128-bit block cipher with a 128-bit key."

### 2.6 Identity-Based Cryptography
A system where public keys are derived from identities (e.g., email addresses):
```
Public Key = ID (e.g., "alice@example.com")
Private Key = f(ID, master_secret)
```
**How it Works:**
- User chooses identity.
- Central authority issues private key corresponding to that identity using its own secret key.

> "Identity-based primitives have been used in a few specialist systems: in Zcash for the payment privacy mechanisms..."

## 3. Cryptographic Protocols

### 3.1 TLS (Transport Layer Security)

**TLS Handshake Process (Simplified):**
```
C → S: ClientHello {name, nonce}
S → C: ServerHello {name, nonce, certificate with public key}
C → S: Encrypted pre-master-secret + Finished message
S → C: Finished message + Data encrypted under master secret
```
**Key Components:**
- **Pre-Master Secret**: Random value exchanged using RSA or Diffie-Hellman.
- **Master Secret**: Derived from pre-master secret and nonces (K1 = h(K0, NC, NS)).
- **Session Keys**: Generated by hashing the master secret with new nonces.

**TLS Versions:**
| Version | Year | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|
| SSL 3.0 | 1996 | Initial version; vulnerable to attacks |
| TLS 1.0 | 1999 | Renamed from SSL 3.0 |
| TLS 1.1 | 2006 | Protection against CBC padding errors |
| TLS 1.2 | 2008 | Support for SHA-256 and authenticated encryption |
| TLS 1.3 | 2019 | Mandatory forward secrecy via Diffie-Hellman |

> "TLS 1.3 dropped backwards compatibility to end support for many old ciphers, and made it mandatory to establish end-to-end forward secrecy by means of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange at the start of each session."

### 3.2 QUIC Protocol
A UDP-based protocol designed as an alternative to TLS:

**Key Features:**
- Faster session establishment (reduces latency)
- Allows sessions to persist across network changes
- Uses cookies holding client's last IP address

> "Google claims it reduces search latency 8% and YouTube buffer time 18%. Independent evaluation suggests that the benefit is mostly on the desktop rather than mobile."

### 3.3 Code Signing
Used for software provenance verification:

**Implementation Challenges:**
- **Key Management**: Developers may keep keys in hardware security modules (expensive, prone to failure).
- **Chain of Trust**: May involve commercial CAs or custom implementations.
- **Verification Mechanisms**: Often involves trusted hardware like TPMs.

> "Code signing isn't quite as easy as it looks, particularly when the user is the enemy."

### 3.4 PGP/GPG
Pretty Good Privacy: Open-source encryption for email:

**Key Features:**
- Manual key management (no central CA).
- Supports both encryption and digital signatures.
- Used by sysadmins, CERTs, malware researchers.

> "Only four of twelve subjects were able to correctly send encrypted email to the other subjects, and every subject made at least one significant error."

## 4. Key Management & Security Concepts

### 4.1 Forward and Backward Security
**Forward Security:**
- If a key is compromised in session i+1, past sessions (i) remain secure.
- Achieved by updating keys using hash functions or message exchanges.
```
K_{i+1} = h(K_i, M_i)
```
> "If an attacker now compromises one of their systems and steals the key, then as soon as they exchange a message which he can't observe or guess, security will be recovered."

**Backward Security:**
- If a key is compromised in session i+1, future sessions (i+2) remain secure.
- Achieved by using hash functions to break chains of compromise.

> "The chain of compromise is broken by the hash function's one-wayness."

### 4.2 Certificate Authorities
**Certificate Structure:**
```
C_A = Sig_KS(TS, L, A, K_A, V_A)
```
Where:
- TS = certificate start time/date
- L = validity period length
- A = user name
- K_A = public encryption key
- V_A = public signature verification key

**Challenges:**
1. **Naming**: Difficult to establish meaningful identities.
2. **Authorization vs Authentication**: Systems often need more than just a name (e.g., security clearance).
3. **Revocation**: Often "flaky" or doesn't work.

> "The revocation of bad certificates is usually flaky, if it works at all."

### 4.3 Threshold Cryptography
A mechanism to split signing/decryption keys among multiple principals:

**Basic Concept:**
- Split key d = d₁ + d₂ + ... + dₙ.
- For k < n, use Lagrange interpolation formula.

> "Threshold signatures were first used in systems where a number of servers process transactions independently and vote independently on the outcome."

### 4.4 Blind Signatures
A technique to sign messages without knowing their content:

**RSA Example:**
1. User takes random R, forms ReM mod n.
2. Signer computes (ReM)d = R·Md mod n.
3. User divides by R to get Md.

> "The first was in digital cash; you might want to be able to issue anonymous payment tokens to customers..."

## 5. Implementation Issues & Attacks

### 5.1 Side-Channel Attacks
Attacks that exploit information leaked through physical implementation rather than mathematical weaknesses:

**Common Types:**
| Attack Type | Information Leaked |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Timing Analysis | Time taken for cryptographic operations |
| Power Analysis | Power consumption during computation |

> "Many of the practical attacks on cryptographic implementations... have exploited side channels such as timing and power analysis."

### 5.2 Poor Random Number Generation
**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- RSA keys with common factors (1 in 172 IoT certs share a factor)
- Predictable seeds for discrete logs

> "Poor random number generators have led to many other failures... The proportion of RSA certs one can find out there on the Internet that share a common factor with other RSA keys has actually risen between 2012 and 2020; 1 in 172 IoT certs are trivially vulnerable."

### 5.3 Common Implementation Flaws
**Examples:**
- **Bleichenbacher Attack**: On SSL v3.0 by sending crafted ciphertexts to observe error messages.
- **Padding Oracle Attacks**: Exploiting padding validation errors.

> "One spectacular example was when Daniel Bleichenbacher found a way to break the RSA implementation in SSL v 3.0..."

### 5.4 Quantum Computing Threat
**Shor's Algorithm:**
- Can factor integers and compute discrete logarithms efficiently on quantum computers.
- Would break all current public-key cryptography.

> "Peter Shor has shown that if a sufficiently large quantum computer could be built, then both factoring and discrete logarithm computations will become easy."

### 5.5 Post-Quantum Cryptography
**Current Status:**
- NIST is standardizing post-quantum algorithms.
- Initial submissions reduced from 65 to 15 through two rounds of review.

> "If elliptic logs become easy, bitcoins will be trivial to forge..."

## 6. Security Strength Comparison

### 6.1 Symmetric vs Asymmetric Key Sizes
| Security Level | Symmetric Key Size (bits) | RSA/ECC Key Size (bits) |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 80 bits        | ~80                        | RSA: ~1024, ECC: ~160    |
| 112 bits       | ~112                       | RSA: ~2048, ECC: ~224    |
| 128 bits       | ~128                       | RSA: ~3072, ECC: ~256    |

> "In order to provide the same level of protection as a symmetric block cipher, asymmetric cryptographic primitives generally require at least twice the block length."

### 6.2 Attack Types and Mitigations
| Threat Type                | Example                     | Mitigation Strategy               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Collision Attacks          | SHA-1 collisions            | Migrate to SHA-2/SHA-3             |
| Side-Channel Analysis      | Timing attacks on RSA       | Constant-time implementations     |
| Poor Random Number Gen.    | Common factors in RSA keys  | Use cryptographically secure RNGs   |
| Weak Key Exchange          | Export-controlled weak keys | Avoid export restrictions         |

## Summary of Critical Concepts

### **Core Principles**
1. **Don't roll your own crypto** - Designing and implementing cryptographic systems is extremely error-prone.
2. **Use established standards** - AES, SHA-3, TLS 1.3 are well-vetted protocols.
3. **Never use ECB mode for encryption** - It preserves patterns in the plaintext.

### **Security Properties**
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Semantic Security | An attacker cannot learn any information about a message from its ciphertext (even with chosen-ciphertext access) |
| Forward Secrecy | Compromising current keys doesn't compromise past communications |
| Backward Secrecy | Compromising current keys doesn't compromise future communications |
