# Chapter 27: Secure Systems Development - Comprehensive Study Notes

## 27.4 Prioritising Protection Goals

### Core Concept
**Risk-Reward Tradeoff**: Security decisions must balance risk mitigation against business value (profit/revenue). Overemphasis on security without considering business impact often leads to suboptimal outcomes.

---

### Key Principles and Concepts

#### **Business Risk vs Reward Analysis**
- **Example 1: Retail Fraud Management**
  - *Scenario*: A retailer with $10M turnover, $1M gross profit, and $150K theft losses.
    - Option A (Security Focus): "Stop theft to increase profits by 15%" â†’ Profit increases from $1M to $1.15M
    - Option B (Business Growth Focus): Double turnover to $20M (even with tripling theft loss to $450K) â†’ New profit = $1.55M (+85% increase)
  - *Key Insight*: Fraud management teams reporting to **Chief Marketing Officer** focus on sales opportunities ("only rejecting 3% of baskets instead of 4%" = +1% sales), while those reporting to **Chief Financial Officer** are seen as cost centers.

- **Example 2: Site Reliability Engineering**
  - *Principle*: Don't aim for "perfect" reliability (e.g., 99.99%) if users won't notice the difference.
  - *Strategy*: Deliberately set an **0.1% error budget** to:
    - Exercise resilience mechanisms through controlled failures
    - Allocate resources productively rather than chasing marginal gains

#### **Security Prioritization Debate**
- **"Tick-box approach"**: "Must have no open CVEs in any software"
  - *Critique*: Imposes high compliance cost, especially for firms that don't write all their own infrastructure (unlike Google)
  - *Reality Check*: Most organizations must prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment

> ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight from Textbook**: "Don't trust people who can only talk about 'tightening security.' Often it's too tight already, and what you really need to do is just focus it slightly differently."

### Case Studies & Real-World Examples

#### **Self-Service Checkout Evolution**
| Era | Approach | Business Outcome |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| 20 Years Ago (Pioneers) | Aggressive security challenges based on product weight | Reduced usability, higher customer frustration |
| Later Industry Standard | Gradual implementation with forgiving approach | Improved adoption and reduced losses through experience |
| Early 2020s (Post-COVID) | Scan-as-you-pick apps for grocery shopping | Increased sales efficiency; Amazon experimenting with fully self-service food stores |

- **Business Lesson**: "Profit is the reward for risk" - Self-service supermarkets were once considered too risky, but now dominate retail.

#### **Zoom Security Crisis**
- *Scenario*: Zoom grew from 20M to 200M users in March 2020
- *Consequence*: Forced into major security engineering effort (shifted from enterprise platform to public utility)
- *Key Insight*: "Entrepreneurs who succeed may have to improve security quickly."

### Safety vs Security Valuation Paradox

| Context | Value of Human Life |
|---------|---------------------|
| Road junction improvements | ~$50,000 per life saved |
| Train protection systems | >$500 million per life saved |
| Flu jabs/cancer screening | Hundreds to thousands per life saved |
| "War on terror" initiatives | Billions per life saved |

> ðŸ’¡ **Psychological Insight**: Safety preferences change dramatically with perceived threat:
> - People may accept 1-in-10,000 risk from medical devices but become alarmed at 1-in-10,000,000 hacking risk.

---

## 27.5 Methodology

### Core Concept
**Software Engineering**: "The establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines."

> ðŸ’¡ **Historical Context**: The term was proposed by Brian Randall (1968) during the "software crisis" when projects consistently failed.

---

### Software Development Models

#### Waterfall Model
- *Definition*: Sequential development process with no feedback from later stages to earlier ones.
  - Requirements â†’ Specification â†’ Implementation & Unit Testing â†’ Integration & System Testing â†’ Field Operations/Maintenance
- **Validation**: Building right system (requirements met)
- **Verification**: Building it right (against specification)

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Early clarification of goals, architecture, interfaces | Requires detailed requirements upfront |
| Clear milestones for project managers | No feedback from testing to requirements |
| Cost transparency through separate billing stages | Not suitable when requirements are unknown |

- **V Model**: Variant used in safety-critical systems (Germany standard)
  - System flows down to implementation â†’ climbs back up verification/validation
  - *Still a one-way process* where requirements drive the system

> ðŸ’¡ **Historical Note**: The waterfall model was originally designed as "a means of getting engineering students started," not an accurate description of experienced designers' work.

---

#### Iterative Development (Agile)
- *Core Philosophy*: "Solve your worst problem. Repeat."
  - Early advocate: Harlan Mills ("build smallest system that works, try with real users")
  - Microsoft's approach contrasted with IBM's waterfall methodology
  - **Key Innovation**: Regression testing at regular intervals

| Waterfall | Agile |
|-----------|-------|
| Requires detailed requirements upfront | Requirements evolve through user feedback |
| Testing happens after development | Continuous integration and automated regression tests |
| "Big bang" deployment | Frequent small deployments |

- *Regression Test*: At regular intervals (typically daily), all code is compiled, tested against large input sets to ensure:
  - Previously working features still work
  - Old bugs haven't reappeared

> ðŸ’¡ **Microsoft vs IBM**: Microsoft's approach enabled them to "take a $100bn business-software market from IBM" through better development methodology.

---

### Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

#### Microsoft SDL Components (2010 Simplified Implementation)
| Phase | Key Activities |
|-------|----------------|
| 1. Requirements | Risk assessment, quality gates ("bug bars"), regular reviews |
| 2. Design | Threat modeling, establish attack surface for detailed design |
| 3. Implementation | Approved tools, avoid unsafe functions, static analysis |
| 4. Verification | Dynamic analysis, fuzz testing, review of attack surface |
| 5. Release | Incident response plan, final security review |

#### Organizational Aspects
- **Security Subject-Matter Expert (SME)**: External to dev team for oversight
- **Security/Privacy Champion**: Within the development team itself

> ðŸ’¡ **Maturity Model Insight**: Microsoft adapted Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from CMU, defining four levels of security maturity:
> - New teams underestimate project work and have high variance in time estimates
> - Mature teams better predict development times while reducing variance

---

### Gated Development for Security

- *Definition*: Pre-release version pushed through additional tests/reviews at regular intervals (e.g., Windows patches)
- **Why it's needed**: 
  - Security properties are emergent and diverse
  - Fewer security engineers compared to developers
  - Limited investment in specialized tools
  - Many vulnerabilities cross system abstraction levels

> ðŸ’¡ **Historical Context**: Microsoft introduced "Patch Tuesday" (monthly updates) in 2003, shifting from ad-hoc patching. From 2003-2015 all customers received patches on the second Tuesday of each month.

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

#### Key Innovations
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Continuous Integration/Deployment | Migrate few users to new version for testing, then rest; controlled experiments with staging environments |
| Canary Deployment | Route 1% traffic to new version ("canary") before full rollout |
| A/B Testing | Measure user reactions to different features (e.g., Google browser warnings) |

#### Business Impact
- **Economics of Testing**: Ability to fix bugs quickly means less testing needed for target quality level
- **Data Utilization**: Monitor all aspects via dashboards; understand usability failures from security/safety/revenue perspectives

> ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight**: "Large firms can optimise their products more quickly than smaller competitors... SaaS not only cuts costs in the short term, but increases lock-in in the long term."

---

### DevOps and DevSecOps

#### Evolution of Development Practices
| Era | Approach | Key Focus |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| 1960s-2000s | Waterfall (IBM) | Requirements-driven development |
| Early 2000s | Agile/DevOps (Microsoft, Google) | Continuous delivery and automation |
| Mid-2010s-Present | DevSecOps | Integrating security into continuous processes |

#### Microsoft vs. Google Ecosystems

| Aspect | Microsoft/Azure Approach | Google Approach |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Security Integration** | "Shift left" - integrate early in development process | Security as part of infrastructure design philosophy |
| **Tools & Automation** | Extend SDL with metrics, threat modeling, crypto standards | Focus on automation for reliability and security |
| **Error Budgets** | 0.1% downtime budget to support experiments | Use error budgets for controlled outages ("chaos monkey") |

> ðŸ’¡ **Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: 
> - Set realistic availability targets (e.g., 99.9%) â†’ use residual 0.1% for recovery, upgrades and experiments
> - "Chaos Monkey" takes down components to test resilience mechanisms

### Vulnerability Lifecycle Management

#### The Vulnerability Cycle Process
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Researcher Discovers Vulnerability] --> B{Disclosure Method}
B -->|Direct Disclosure| C[Vendor Patch]
B -->|Bug Bounty Program| D[Vendor Pays Reward]
B -->|Public Disclosure| E[Attack in Wild]
E --> F[Patch Released]
F --> G[Customers Apply Patches]
```
#### Stakeholder Interests
| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| Vendor | Minimize patching cost; avoid liability for customer devices needing patches (e.g., cars) |
| Customer | Avoid hassle of patching; may fail to apply updates |
| Researcher | Get reward (cash, fame); fix systems they rely on |
| Intelligence Agencies | Learn vulnerabilities quickly for zero-day exploits |
| Security Software Firms | Benefit from unpatched vulnerabilities in their products |

> ðŸ’¡ **Critical Insight**: "The threat of eventual disclosure got vendors off their butts; the delay gave them time to test a proper fix."

---

### Coordinated Disclosure

- *Definition*: Process where multiple parties coordinate vulnerability reporting and patching
  - Critical for complex systems with many dependencies (e.g., Linux in embedded devices)

#### Case Study: Volkswagen vs. Academics
| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Researchers discovered vulnerabilities in VW remote key entry system, responsibly disclosed to supplier |
| Supplier told VW only at last minute; VW sued researchers instead of fixing issue |
| **Result**: Court case against VW (lost), public attention on vulnerability |

> ðŸ’¡ **Lesson Learned**: "Running bug bounty programs and monthly patching works better than threatening to sue people."

---

### Security Incident Response Plan

#### Four Essential Components
1. **Monitoring**
   - Build threat intelligence team; operate honeypots for IoT devices
   - Engage with ecosystem (bug bounties, CERTs, CVEs)

2. **Repair**
   - Prepare orchestrated response from intrusion detection through to dev teams
   - Alternative communication channels needed in emergencies

3. **Distribution**
   - Deploy patches rapidly: advance planning essential for consumer device patching
   - Balance between quick adoption (pioneers) and thorough testing (later adopters)

4. **Reassurance**
   - Educate CEO/board about need to respond quickly/honestly with compelling examples
   - Have press releases ready for incidents of varying severity

> ðŸ’¡ **Critical Insight**: "Information security is a CEO issue" â€“ breach can lead to loss of customers, stock price hit, or even CEO firing.

## 27.5.8 Organizational Mismanagement of Risk

### Key Failure Patterns
| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Requirement Fluctuation | Thin spread of domain knowledge â†’ conflicting requirements â†’ communication breakdown (e.g., London Ambulance Service disaster) |
| Y2K Success Story | Known requirement ("keep working through 2000") led to successful implementation despite scale |

#### Why Organizations Fail
- **Middle Managers**: Prefer checklist-based approaches over open learning processes
- **CISO Challenges**: 
  - "Good CISOs are almost as rare as hens' teeth"
  - Average tenure: ~2 years (high stress, constant saying no)
  - Requires people skills beyond technical expertise

> ðŸ’¡ **Bezos' Law**: You can't run a dev project with more people than can be fed from two pizzas. Team of eight is about the limit.

---

### Risk Culture and Organizational Factors
- **Cultural Embedding**: Controls must fit organizational culture (e.g., dual-control safe locks in banks)
- **Moral Hazard**: Dumping risks on third parties removes incentives to take care (e.g., payment systems shifting fraud liability)

#### Example: Henry Ford's Product Liability Approach
> "If you were injured by one of his cars, you should sue the driver, not him" â€“ took decades for courts/lawmakers to establish product liability.

---

## Comprehensive Summary

### Key Takeaways from Chapter 27.4 & 27.5

1. **Security Prioritization**: Balance risk mitigation with business value (profit/revenue), don't just "tighten security"
   
2. **Development Methodologies**:
   - Waterfall: Good for known requirements, safety-critical systems
   - Agile/DevOps: Better for evolving needs and rapid feedback

3. **Secure Development Lifecycle**: 
   - Microsoft's SDL integrates security throughout development process
   - "Shift left" means integrating security early in the cycle

   - Coordinated disclosure essential for complex systems with many dependencies

5. **Organizational Culture**: 
   - Security must be a CEO-level concern
   - CISO role requires people skills beyond technical expertise
   - Risk culture varies by industry and influences security decisions

6. **SaaS & DevSecOps**:
   - Continuous deployment enables rapid fixes but creates new challenges
   - "Chaos monkey" approach to test resilience mechanisms is now standard practice
