I need to create comprehensive, well-structured markdown notes from the lecture slides and transcript for COMP SCI 3307/7307 - Secure Programming, Week 1.

Let me analyze the content and organize it into a logical structure for my notes.

First, I'll identify the main sections from the slides and transcript:

1. Course introduction and acknowledgments
2. Why secure programming is needed (with examples)
3. Course overview and structure
4. Course prerequisites and expectations
5. Course assessment details
6. RangeForce platform details
7. Group project details (Advanced Secure Protocol Design, Implementation and Review)
8. Late submission and academic integrity policies

Now I'll organize these into a logical flow for my notes.

I'll start with a title and overview, then go through each section in detail, synthesizing both the slides and transcript.

Let me create the notes:

# Title: COMP SCI 3307/7307 - Secure Programming Week 1 Notes
# Date: [Current Date]

## Overview
This document contains comprehensive notes for Week 1 of COMP SCI 3307/7307 - Secure Programming, covering course introduction, rationale for secure programming, course structure, assessment details, and key concepts.

Now I'll create the detailed notes section by section.

First, I'll cover the acknowledgments and course introduction from Slide 2 and the transcript.

Then I'll cover the "Why Secure Programming?" section with examples from Slides 4, 9, 10, 11, and the transcript.

Next, I'll cover the course overview, prerequisites, and expectations from Slides 14-15.

Then I'll cover the assessment details from Slides 18-19, 20-34, and the transcript.

Then I'll cover the RangeForce platform details from Slides 19-34.

Then I'll cover the group project details from Slides 35-37 and the transcript.

Finally, I'll cover the late submission policy, academic integrity, and key takeaways.

Let me now create the detailed notes in markdown format.

# COMP SCI 3307/7307 - Secure Programming: Week 1 Comprehensive Notes
**Date:** August 1, 2024

## Course Overview
This course provides an advanced exploration of secure programming principles, emphasizing the importance of security throughout the software development lifecycle. The course covers vulnerabilities, threat modeling, secure protocol design, and practical implementation techniques. It is designed for students with strong programming backgrounds who want to develop expertise in creating secure systems.

---

## Why Secure Programming? (The Critical Need)

### Safety vs. Security in Different Domains
- **Aviation Safety Analogy**: 
  - In aviation, safety is prioritized above all else (e.g., delaying flights for safety checks)
  - *Example*: A flight was delayed 30 minutes due to suspected wheel issues, requiring emergency visas for passengers
  - *Key Insight*: "Safety is first" in aviation, but what about programming?

- **Programming Priorities Survey**:
  - Students ranked priorities as: **Maintainability (A)** > **Functionality (D)** > **Performance** > **Security (B)**
  - *Important Note*: While security is increasingly important, most students still prioritize maintainability and functionality first

### Real-World Consequences of Insecure Programming

#### 1. **CrowdStrike Incident (2023)**
- **Cause**: Vulnerability in Windows update
- **Impact**: 
  - Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) across millions of systems
  - 2-day disruption to critical services (payments, transportation)
  - *Example*: "Many of my colleagues couldn't take the tram or train in Sydney or Melbourne"

#### 2. **Log4j Vulnerability (2021-2022)**
- **Cause**: Vulnerability in Apache Log4j library (used for logging)
- **Impact**:
  - Affected global systems using Java
  - Allowed remote code execution (attackers could gain full system control)
  - *Key Insight*: "A small building block inside a huge system. When it breaks, the whole system can collapse."

#### 3. **FrostyGoop Malware (2024)**
- **Target**: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in Ukraine
- **Impact**:
  - Targeted ENCO controllers using Modbus TCP
  - Caused loss of heating services to 600+ apartment buildings (100,000 people)
  - Duration: 48 hours without heating/hot water
  - *Key Insight*: "Malware not only affects normal people but even large corporations with strict security policies"

### Root Causes of Cyber Attacks
- **Vulnerabilities** stem from:
  - **Software** (most common)
  - **Hardware**
  - **Networks**
  - **Human factors** (weakest link in security)
- **Human Vulnerabilities**:
  - Developers not prioritizing security
  - Lack of security awareness
  - Clicking suspicious links (phishing)
  - *Mitigation*: University provides security training to raise awareness

### Vulnerability Statistics
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**:
  - Unique identifiers for vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2023-1234)
  - Format: `CVE-YEAR-NNNNN`
  - *Example*: `CVE-2023-1234` (2023, 1234th vulnerability reported)
- **Trend**: Number of vulnerabilities increasing exponentially since 2017
  - *Key Insight*: "Even if everyone learns secure programming, the number keeps increasing because software complexity grows exponentially"

## Key Takeaways

1. **Security is Critical**: Insecure programming leads to real-world consequences (e.g., heating systems failing, financial losses)
2. **Security is Not an Afterthought**: Must be integrated from the design phase (Security by Design)
3. **This is an Advanced Course**: Requires strong programming skills and prior knowledge
4. **Group Project is Central**: Focuses on protocol design, secure implementation, and peer review
5. **RangeForce is Mandatory**: Complete all modules for 30% of your grade
6. **AI Usage Requires Discernment**: Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement for your own understanding
7. **Security is a Continuous Process**: Vulnerabilities increase exponentially as software complexity grows
8. **Human Factor is Critical**: "Human is the weakest link in security" - awareness is key
